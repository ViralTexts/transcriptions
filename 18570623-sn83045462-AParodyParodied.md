Some fair writer thus retaliates on the parodist whose production we published some days since. Both sides must be heard, and we give the lady a chance:


- {:.indent-3}Tell me, ye winged winds
- {:.indent-3}That round my pathway roar,
- {:.indent-3}Do ye not know some spot
- {:.indent-3}Where bachelors come no more—
- {:.indent-3}Some lone and pleasant dell
- {:.indent-3}Where no moustache is seen—
- {:.indent-3}Where long eared dandies never come
- {:.indent-3}Ourselves and fun between?
- There came a murmur from the distant lee—
- A low, sad tone, which whispered 'No-sir-ee.'


- {:.indent-3}Tell me, thou misty deep,
- {:.indent-3}Whose billows round me play,
- {:.indent-3}Know'st thou some favored spot,
- {:.indent-3}Some island far away,
- {:.indent-3}Where weary girls may find
- {:.indent-3}A rest from soft dough faces,
- {:.indent-3}And hear themselves called women,
- {:.indent-3}Nor likened to the graces?
- Soon did the misty deep its answer give,
- By murmuring, "Not while brandy smashes live."


- {:.indent-3}And thou, serenest moon,
- {:.indent-3}What language dost thou utter
- {:.indent-3}While gazing on the GENTLEMAN,
- {:.indent-3}Whose head is in the gutter?
- {:.indent-3}Say, hast thou in thy round
- {:.indent-3}Gazed on some favored spot,
- {:.indent-3}Where <em>hats know not the weight of bricks</em>,
- {:.indent-3}And where cigars are not?
- Behind a cloud the moon withdrew in woe,
- But in italics answered, "<em>No, no, no!</em>"


- {:.indent-3}Tell me, my secret soul—
- {:.indent-3}Oh! tell me, Hope and Faith,
- {:.indent-3}Is there no resting place
- {:.indent-3}From fops and beaux and death?
- {:.indent-3}Is there no happy spot,
- {:.indent-3}Where womankind are blest—
- {:.indent-3}Where man may never come,
- {:.indent-3}And where the girls may rest?
- Faith, Truth, and Hope—best boons to mortals given,
- Waved their bright wings and answered "Yes, in Heaven."
