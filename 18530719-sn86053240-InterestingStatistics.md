INTERESTING STATISTICS.

A gentleman who keeps the run of facts, figures, and babies, has just laid before "an inquiring world" the following statistics:

The whole number of languages spoken in the world amount to 3,064; viz., 587 in Europe, 937 in Asia, 276 in Africa, and 1,264 in America.—The inhabitants of our globe profess more than 1,000 different religions. The number of men is about equal to the number of women. The average of human life is about 33 years. One fourth die previous to the age of 7 years, one half before reaching 17 years of age, and those who pass that age enjoy a felicity (?) refused to one half the human species. To every 1,000 persons only one reaches 100 years of age; to every 100, only six reach the age of 66, and not more than one in 500 live to 80 years of age. 

There are on the earth, 1,000,000,000 of inhabitants, and of these 333,333,333 die every year, 91,324 every day, 3,730 every hour, 60 every minute, or 1 every second. These losses are about balanced by an equal number of births. The married are longer lived than single, and, above all, those who observe a sober and industrious conduct. Tall men live longer than short ones! Women have more chances of life in their favor previous to being 50 years of age than men, but fewer afterwards.

The number of marriages is in proportion of 175 to 1,000 individuals. Marriages are more frequent after the equinoxes—that is during the months of June and December. Those born in the spring are generally more robust than others. Births and deaths are more frequent by night than by day. The number of men capable of working or bearing arms, is calculated at one-fourth of the population.

Some of these statements are rather singular, and yet many of them are susceptible of an easy solution. That marriages take place more frequently in June and December, than other months of the year, was just what we have always suspected was the case. Those who marry in June, do so because they can't help it; while those who connubialize in December, do so doubtless, to guard against the chilly pillows which distinguish the frost-bitten months of winter. Those matches which come off in June are commonly love-matches, and are brought about by green fields, and the contagious influence of bobolinks and yellow birds; while those which happen in December are brought about in a great degree by mixing plain mathematics with the market value of flannel undergarments.
