**House Cleaning**

BY WITCH Hazel

Every year I endeavor to make some improvement in my method of house cleaning. This spring, I made up my mind to adhere no longer to the poky old plan of my grandmother—which was to begin in the attic, and wind up in the cellar—but determined to strike out in another direction; and so, while the subject was rife in my mind, I set about executing my new plan at once although it was but the first of April, and the weather quite chilly and raw. In the first place, I had every stove moved out, then every carpet taken up, all the pictures removed from the walls, the curtains down, everything piled out on the back porch, and the carpetless halls crammed to overflowing with books, chairs, statues, feather dusters, vases, hair mattresses, parian brackets, and pillows; and while everything was in the wildest confusion, Frank came in with distended eyes.

'What on earth is all this, Hattie?' he exclaimed.

'Why Frank,' I replied, pausing in my efforts to reach a swaying cobweb, 'we have commenced cleaning house,' and I lowered my broom, and looked straight in his face to see if he fully realized the importance of these words; but to my chagrin, he looked utterly indifferent, and brushing off some stray cobwebs which had floated down from the ceiling, on to his coat sleeve, asked impatiently, 'Isn't dinner ready?' 'Dinner!' I cried; 'I had no idea it was so late. I haven't even commenced dinner yet.'

'Pretty state of affairs,' grumbled Frank. 'I brought Ed Graham home with me.'

'Where is he?' I asked faintly.

'In the parlor,' replied Frank crustily. 'The floor is bare; there is'n a chair or anything else for the man to sit on. I expect to find him seated on the piano. But come, Hattie,' he added, 'what are you going to give us to eat?'

'O, Frank,' I said coaxingly, thinking of my rought hair and the grease spot on my dress, 'can't you get your dinner down town to-day?'

Frank looked cross, and said he supposed he could, and went down to the parlor. I leaned over the banister, and when Frank opened the door, caught a glimpse of Ed roaming around the desolate room, shivering with his hands in his pockets. I watched them go through the hall heard Frank make some hateful remarks about women and house cleaning. He slammed the door violently, and I serenely resumed my sweeping, not in the least disturbed by Franks unconcealed annoyance and provoking manner. Frank was always a little unreasonable; and he was always bringing someone home to dinner when I least expected it.

Just then, little Ted came toddling in, and wanted to help. As I was about to make a change of base, I took him with me down to the parlor, gave him a rag and a basin of water, and told him he might clean the floor. He sat down in one corner of the room, and with a face of most unearthly solemnity, at once commenced a vigorous scrubbing. Norah was up stairs, washing windows in the front chamber. Suddenly there came a loud crash, followed by a terrific yell; it sounded as if the whole house was tumbling down. 'Heavens!' I exclaimed, 'what can have happened.' I mounted the stairs, two steps at a time, and there beheld Norah lying full length on the floor, admist a debris of broken step ladder, pieces of glass and soap suds.

'What is the matter?' I cried to the groaning girl.

'Shure, mum, I fell of the ladder the windy, an' cut myself most awful,' moaned the terrified girl.

I helped the heavy girl to arise, bound up her lacerated arm, left her to pick up the fragments of glass and wood, and returned to the palor to find Ted scouring the piano legs with the scrubbing brush. I quickly relieved him from all further labor, bundled him up and sent him out in the yard to play.

'Faith mum,' said Norah, standing in the door, 'I feel so faint, an' an if I don't make something strong I can't work no more to-day.'

'Then make you some tea,' I replied.

But Norah disdainfully said, 'Shure I never could take tea; the very smill of it makes me sick.'

'Well, then, take some brandy,' I replied. Now I ought to have known better than to allow Norah to help herself to the brandy, but being in such a hurry to finish the parlor I could not conveniently stop. When I had occasion to go through the hall again, I paused and listened; I could hear nothing of Norah moving about, so once more I mounted the stairs. There, in the midst of the room, she sat in a rocking chair, a bucket of water stood before her, while she swayed <sic>laizily</sic> back and forth with the mop in her hand, which left a long trail of dirty water behind it.

'Norah,' I cried, 'didn't I tell you to mop this floor?'

'Faith, mum, and I am doing it as fast as I can,' she replied.

'How can you mop sitting down?' I asked indignantly.

'Get up out of that chair,' I said. Norah slowly arose and staggered against the wall.

'Hie, mum, hie, yez see I's very wake.'

'You're drunk, you had better say,' I replied.

'Drunk, d'ye call it!' exclaimed Norah angrily, trying to look dignified; 'drunk, after taking one tay-spoonful of brandy in a quart of water!'

'Leave the room and go to bed,' I said indignantly; 'to-morrow I shall dismiss you.'

After much arguing Norah finally decided to retire, and I was sole monarch of all the dirt and disorder. I surveyed the room in despair, but the word had to be done, and I seized the mop and soon finished. When I was about to descend the stairs, all tired and dirty, I heard Frank calling, 'Hattie! where in the world are you?'

'Here,' I replied.

Frank came up the uncarpeted stairs and tumbled over the mop. 'Confound it!' he cried 'the house is as dark as Egypt? Well,' he went on, 'are we going supperless as well as dinnerless?'

'There is no fire made,' I said, 'and Norah is drunk, and I am tired to death; and—and' here I burst into tears, and sat down on the wet floor.

'Why Hattie! what are you crying about! I'll make the fire; never mind about the supper; had a capital dinner down town; come down stairs out of this damp room.' And Frank, who always got good and sorry the moment after he was cross, helped me off the floor, and down stairs into the kitchen. 'Now don't cry any more,' he said wiping the tears from my cheeks with his handkerchief; sit down, and I'll have a fire in two minutes.'

'Where is Ted?' he inquired, pausing between the vigorous puffs at the fire.

'I have not seen him all afternoon. I sent him out to play, and he hasn't been in since,' I replied.

Frank dropped the shavings and started out in search of him. I waited and waited, and shivered with the cold, but no Frank came. I sat in the stiff-backed chair and closed my eyes. The last thing I remembered was a violent nod which pretty nearly dislocated my neck.

'Hattie!' I awoke with a start. Frank was shaking me.

'You will take your death of cold; you have been fast asleep.'

'Where is Ted? did you find him in the cistern?' I asked dreamily.

'No,' laughed Frank, 'but about as bad; the poor fellow was in the coal cellar, asleep like his mother.'

I rubbed my eyes and looked at the child; he was covered with coal dust from head to foot, and was black as a negro. Frank prepared supper, while I washed Ted's face and hands.

'How can you finish your cleaning without Norah?' he inquired.

'I am sure I don't see how I can,' I replied as the mountains of work arose in my troubled mind. 'Norah must be sent away in the morning.'

We all ate heartily of our supper, notwithstanding the eggs were fried until they were so crisp that they would break into bits if you such much as looked at them, and the toast was burnt, and the coffee not half boiled; still as I was ravenously hungry, it all tasted pretty good. After we had cleared the table and piled the dishes away to be washed in the morning, we retired, and being so fatigued I did not awaken until late in the morning. Norah was dismissed, Frank went to his office, and I to my cleaning. Frank had shaken the carpets, and the parlor floor being dry, I soon had it all tacked down; then moved the chairs in, and began to dust the mantle ornaments, but O horror! I let fall one of my loveliest vases and shivered it into a thousand fragments. A very bad beginning of the day, I thought sorrowfully, picking up the pieces.

'Mamma,' cried a shrill voice, 'I's all jess up.'

'Where are you Ted?' I called.

'Here,' cried Ted.

'And where is 'here;' you're in some mischief I'll be bound.'

I heard Ted's chuckling laugh, and a great scrambling up the attic stairs. After I had thrown the shattered pieces of my vase away, I ran up stairs to see what he was doing. What a sight met my eyes? Ted was arrayed in my violet silk, pinned up in front, and trailing far behind on the floor, my white lace shawl around his shoulders, and my best bonnet on his head. I stood transfixed for a moment, while Ted went prancing round and round in the dust and dirt of the attic; then I started after him. Of course he ran, screaming and laughing. 'Take care,' I cried, but too late; he fell from the top to the bottom of the stairs.

Rip, rip, went my violet silk; bump, bump went Ted. I flew down to the bottom of the stairs, and picked up a little insensible heap of lace, ribbons, silk, and dirt. That fall saved Ted from a good whipping. I carried him down stairs, and sprinkled him profusely with water, and camphor, until he opened his eyes; then I examined my ruined clothes. My dress was a mass of cobwebs, grease, and dust; the front width was wretchedly torn with pins; my shawl and bonnet were crushed and torn. I put them all away with a sigh of regret, and turned my attention once more to the <sic>prepetrator</sic> of this terrible deed. Just then some one knocked at the back door. On opening it I found a stout German girl on the step; she talked so broken that I could scarcely understand her, but managed to comprehend enough to know that Frank had engaged her for me. I set her to work immediately to clearn the china closet, and returned to my wounded Ted. Suddenly I heard a terrible crash in the dining room. 'Heavens!' I exclaimed; 'what can have happened *now*? and rushing out I found the frightened girl clasping and unclasping her hands in a heart rending manner. No wonder. She had upset the table on which all my shining glass and china was placed. Everything was literally smashed to pieces. My beautiful celery glasses! My goblets, and tea set! My fruit stands! Was there ever such a poor afflicted mortal as I? Words fail me to express my feelings at that moment. I sat down, perfectly stunned, to witness the harrowing sight of all my superb dishes swept away.

There came another knock at the door. This time an Irish girl made her appearance. I wonder if Frank intended to send a regiment to destroy my house. However, I took her in, and the first thing I told her to do was answer the door bell, which had rung twice. I peeped through the door, which was partly open, and saw two ladies, but could not distinguish who they were.

'Mum, there are two wimmen as wants to see yez,' said Ann, giving the door a violent push against my head.

'Go tell them to excuse me,' I said, and being very dizzy from the blow, I did not notice that Ann, in her stupidity, had left the sitting room door open, and as the ladies came out of the parlor they saw me plainly.

'O mortification!' I was all rags and dirt, but had become somewhat reconciled to my misfortunes by this time.

When Frank cmae home to supper, the hall was very dark; Ann was putting down the door mat. Frank forgot all about the new servant, and in the darkness mistook the horrid girl for me, and kissed her. Ann screamed and ran, and fell over a chair. Frank tore round and swore; said he would rather be in bedlam than where a woman was cleaning house; wondered why I couldn't have the hall lighted. To all this I made no reply, but smiled grimly, being so overwhelmed with my griefs, I did not care if Frank kissed every servant girl in the United States.

    The next morning the German girl left. Probably she was fearful she would counter my frowns again. Ann remained and we proceeded to finish our havoc. The day was gloriously begun by Ann, who succeeded charmingly in breaking the globes of the chandelier, and then upsetting my gold fish. I was exasperated at this. There lay my fish on the carpet, to say nothing of the water. I believe I shook or slapped the girl. I don't remember which. Ann was astonished at seeing me fly into such a passion that she baked up against the window, and thrust her clumsy foot through my lace curtain. This was the grand finale. I burst into tears, and so did Ann. Ted, hearing the sobs, came running in, and not knowing what to make of it, joined in and swelled the chorus. Amidst one of our loudest wails, the street door suddenly opened, and in walked my aunt Thankful, with several dozen carpet bags and bundles, prepared evidently for a long visit.

'In the name of all that's wonderful!' she shrieked, letting all her traps fall. 'What has happened? Is Frank dead, Ted scalded, or the house on fire?'

I made no reply, but sobbed heedlessly on.

'Hattie!' cried aunt Thankful in an awful voice. 'Answer me immediately. What is the matter?'

'My lace curtain,' I gurgled out.

Aunt Thankful put on her spectacles, sat down on the floor and examined it. 'Silly puss,' she mumbled. 'I can darn that in ten minutes.'

'Yes, with blue stocking yarn,' I said, and began to laugh sarcastically, and then I laughed and laughed. Ann laughed, and Ted laughed. Poor Aunt Thankful stared at us in horror, and said:

'Good Heavens! they are all stark mad;' and jumping up off the floor, she seized my arm and dragged me into the bed room, and put me to bed, then went out and locked the door, and left me alone. I went to sleep. When I awoke Aunt Thankful was sitting by my bed sewing.

'Aunt Thankful,' I said, 'when did you come?'

'Yesterday morning,' she replied.

'What time is it now?' I inquired.

'Three o'clock,' answered Aunt Thankful.

'I have slept several hours then,' I said. 'Was I asleep when you came?'

'I should rather think not: when I came you were crazy, and I put you to bed. You slept all the rest of the day and night until this blessed minute, and if you hadn't been put to bed you would have been in the insane asylum now.'

I began to laugh. Aunt Thankful glared at me and said:

'If you laugh any more I will put you into the cellar, and feed you on bread and water for a week.'

This not being a pleasant prospect, I subsided.

'You are a precious woman to clean house,' continued she. 'I should have tought a child would know better than to commence in the attic and go down. Don't know you that after you get through with the down stairs the dirt from the attic will make it dirtier than ever?'

'I never thought of that,' I answered meekly.

'And then to begin when it's cold enough to freeze. It's a wonder you didn't have the lung fever, or something worse,' went on Aunt Thankful.

'I must get up and clean the attic,' I said.

'No you won't,' said Aunt Thankful, 'for I cleaned it myself.'

'Well, there are the rest of the carpets to put down.'

'They're all down.'

'And the pictures.'

'All hung.'

I gave a great sigh of relief. What would I have done if it had not been for Aunt Thankful! She had accomplished in one day what it would have taken me a week to perform; but then I never could bob round like Aunt Thankful; she seems to be made of wire. I have learned since then to take Aunt Thankful's advice, never to commence cleaning until the weather is warm, and never to commence at the wrong end of the house.

But it was such a mortification to think that my new plan was a total failure.—*Hearth and Home*.
