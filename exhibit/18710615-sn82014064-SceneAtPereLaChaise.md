THE SCENE AT PERE LA CHAISE

Another letter says: "The cemetary at Pare La Chaise presents a deplorable sight. The monuments have been greatly injured by the firing. Coffins have been broken, and the remains lie scattered over the ground. You may measure the dead not by numbers, but by the rod. They lie in a double tier on the grass, powdered over with a coating of lime. There are many women among them, and faces the ferocity of which makes one sick to look upon."
