An English chemist has been experimenting for the purpose of ascertaining how much of various kinds of foods must be eaten in order to make one pound of flesh. He comes to the conclusion that it requires 25 pounds of milk, 100 of turnips, 50 of potatoes, 50 of carrots, 9 of oat-meal, 7 1/8 barley-meal, and 3 1/2 of peas or beans.
