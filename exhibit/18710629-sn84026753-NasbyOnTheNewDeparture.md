**Nasby on the New Departure.**

[From the Toledo Blade.]

Confederate X Roads, (wich iz in the State of Kentucky, May 24, 1871)

A calm and comprehensive survey uv the politikle field satisfied me, some months ago, that without some shift in the position uv the Dimocrisy, our hope uv success wuz exceedingly thin. The resolooshens interdoost by Vallandygham into the convenshun uv the Dimocrisiy uv Montgomery county, Ohio, wuz to be a new life. Troo, they hev the slite disadvantage uv adjoorin everything that is Dimocratic, and uv puttin the Dimocratic party on purely Republikin ground, but wat uv that? I kin stand even so sudden a change ez that! Wat I want iz the soopreme happiness uv kickin that nigger Lubbock out uv the postoffis at the Corners, and uv puttin myself in his place, and Kernel McPelter and Elder Pennibacker, who hev bin languishin outside the offices uv assessor and collector are actooatid by the same high and holy impulses. Ef to do this requires okkepyin uv Republikin ground, the war cry uv us three iz "okkepy." Kentucky iz shoor to go Dimocratic anyhow, and if we kin by so simple a process ez passin resolooshens indoose enuff dissatisfied Republikins in the close Northern States to vote with us to elect a Dimocratic President who will give us these boons, we three are for passin these resolooshens no matter what they are. This bein my understandin uv Vallandygum's movement, I actid onto it to wunst.

I got the leedin Dimocrisy uv the Corners together one nite at Bascom's. That I mite get em all at one time, I waited till the regler evenin for the raid on the niggers and Northern settlers up toards Garrettstown, knowin that on their return they'd all stop at Bascom's for a drink, and that ef they'd bin successful in their hangin and burnin they'd be in good humor and ready to adopt anything I shood suggest. It wuz a very short but a very satisfactry consultashen. There wuz some objickshuns on the part uv Dimocratic idees, but Bascom settled their hash in very short metre. He remarkt that it wuz necessary that the offfises be in the hands uv his friends for obvius reasons. He wantid pay and he knowed uv no uthor way to git it. He beleeved in the fullest freedom uv though and ackshen, and that every one shood express hisself untrammeled, but he coodent abide a idiot. If there wuz any one in that assemblage so stoopid ez to differ with him on that question, let him make hisself known. No sich man shood ever git a drop at his bar, never; sich a one wuz not deservin uv even the commonest nesesaries uv life. Several who had riz to their feet to object dropt ez though they hed bin shot.

It wuz determined to hold a public meetin the next nite at the church to make a public endorsement uv Vallandygum's idees.

Ez the principal objict uv the meetin wuz to convins the Republikins uv the doubtful States that the Dimocrisy uv the South really accepted the situashun, and ment, in ded ernest, to recognize the great prinsiple uv equality, I arranged to hev all the niggers uv the Corners present, and saved for them the best seats in the ouse. Joe Biglor and Pollock cum uv course, wich I coodent help.

I opened the exercises by making a short speech ez I took the chair. I rejoist thet the time hed finally arriv when the lion and the lamb hed lain down together, and a small child wuz leading uv em. I knowed thet our colored fellow-citizens hed been dispitefully yoosed, and thet doo respeck hed not been alluz paid to our fellow-citizens uv the North, but that time hed now passed, and I hoped forever. The Dimocrisy uv the North, Vallandygum, hed spoke they hed accepted the situashun, halleloogy, and from this time henceforth and forever there wuz to be nothin but peece. I then offered the follerin resolooshen:

"*Resolved*, That the Dimocrisy uv the Yoonited States recognize the legality uv all the amendments made to the Constitooshen dooring and since the late onpleasantnis, and that they recognise and most heartily acquiesce in all the results uv the war; that they not only withdraw all their opposishen to yooniversal suffrage, but pledge theirselves to see that our Afrikin fellow-citizens hev not only this but all other rites heretofore enjoyed excloosively by the Caucashen."

I put the question ez to the adopshen uv the resolooshen, and it wuz carried yoonanimusly. It wood hev been well hed I stopped there, but I didn't. My prevalin weekness is to slop over, and I slopt on this okkasion fearfully. I called upon the citizens uv the Corners to prove their faith by their works. "There are," I said, in a spasm of delite, "preset at this meetin twenty two uv our fellow-citizens uv Afrikin descent. Let em step forred on this platform--let Deekin Pogram, Elder Pennibacker, Bascom, Issaker Gavitt, and eighteen other white citizens step forred also. Let them clasp each other by the hand while I wave over em a flag uv our common kontry."

It wuz done. The twenty-two niggers stepped forred, the whites designated advanced, the two lines grasped each other by the hand, and I was about to wave, when Joe Bigler rize. He begged me to wait a minnit till he made his remark. The site afore him moved him almost to tears. Ef he had ever harbored a suspishen that there wuzn't anything generous in the Kentucky breast he took it all back. The acshun uv to-night wuz not only just but it wuz generous.

"Generous!" sed I, "why generous?"

"Becoz," said he, "the niggers wood be in a devlish bad way ef yoo hedn't decided on given them their rites uv yoor own akkord, for ther ain't no power now that kin compel yoo to do it. I jist got a Northern paper--alas! the Republikin party is split into fragments--remarkably small fragments. Grant assaulted Sumner in the Capitol, Logan hez been stoned by the Republikins uv Philadelfy on his way home, the central committees uv Ohio, Injeany, and Illinoy hev divided, and each fracshen haz called a convenshen, and the Noo York *Triboon* throws up the sponge and sez that nothin under the hevin can prevent the success uv the Democratic candidate for the Presidency, no matter who he may be or wat platform he is put onto. In view uv the disolooshen uv the Republikin party, and the fact that the niggers ain't now got no perteckers, it's really generous that yoo--"

"The Republikin party is gone to pieces! hez it?" gasped my twenty-two white friends in korious.

"It hez!" responded Bigler.

"Then," said Deekin Pogram, his eyes flashin with unwonted fire, "what we've done and sed don't count! Take that, you black cuss?"

And with a strength and activity which I hadn't lookt for in one so agid, the Deekin fecht the darkey whose hand he hed bin graspin, a most powerful blow atween the eyes which histed him clean off the platform, the others followed soot, and in their zeal sprang off the platform after em, and wuz a executin war dances uv the most frantic descripshen onto their prostrate bodies. It wuz with difficulty that Pollock and Bigler restrained em from takin uv em out and hanging uv em.

Ez a matter uv course the resalooshen wuz recinded, and others adopted affirm our adherence to the constitooshen ez it yoost to be, the illegality uv the amendments, and the nateral soopremacy uv the white man over the d--d nigger, after wich we adjourned to Bascom's, ez is our custom, and there organized fresh raids onto our nateral enemies.

The next morning I noticed a pecoolyer look on Bigler's face and likewise on Pollock's. They grinned at me ez I passed, with a broadnis wich I couldn't account for. Lubbock, the nigger postmaster, bust into a roar ez I walked into his offis, and I angrily demanded the reason for his hilarity. 

"Dat mistake ob Biglers," returned he, laughing louder than before.

"What mistake?" I asked, turning pale, for a suspishen was creepin over me.

"Why, he didn't get no paper at all, and--"

"And all that story about the split in the Republikin party North wuz one uv his infernal lies!"

"Dat's about de correct state ob de case!" replied the nigger, showin all his ivories. "Bigler want to see ef yoor 'pentance wuz genoeine--dat's about all dah wuz ob it. He sprest a desire to assertane jist how peeceable yood be to de nigger and de Northern people down heah, ef dah wuzn't no 'Publikin party up North to hold yoo; dat wuz all."

And the nigger laffed a feendish laff.

"Dat wuz all!" he repeated.

It wuz enuff. I guess the cuss found out all that he wanted to. Uv cours this 'outrage,' ez they call it, will get into the Northern papers, and uv cours Vallandygum's assershun will explode itself without hurtin anybody. Joe Bigler iz my evil genius. I shel never be able to run things ez i want to so long ez he lives.
