One sparkling jewel, green as an emerald, grows brighter and brighter in the starry skies ahead of the rocket ship. We are on the frontiers of the solar system, approaching the sea-green planet, Uranus.
The sun is more than a billion miles behind us. We can see it from the rear portholes of the rocket ship, but it is not the majestic sun we are accustomed to on earth. It is about one three-hundredths as bright as from the earth, and reminds us only of a very bright arc lamp set among the stars.
We have crossed the orbit of Jupiter, largest of all the planets, the orbit of Saturn, the ringed-planet, and now are approaching the planet Uranus. We see the green planet ahead, growing larger and larger.
But suddenly we hear the sound of a gong throughout the rocket ship. It is the dinner gong. The chief navigator assures us that we still are some hour's away from the planet and that there is plenty of time for dinner. Accordingly, we make our way to the dining salon.
“l thought is appropriate that we pay honor tonight to Sir William Herschel, discoverer of that planet toward which we are now speeding,” our navigator explains. 
As dinner is completed, we linger over our coffee and ask our navigator, who is also a world-famous astronomer, to tell us about Herschel. “Sir William was one of the most interesting and picturesque figures in the whole history of astronomy,” he tells us. "He was a star-gazing musician, who created world-wide excitement by discovering the planet Uranus."
“He launched himself upon as Herculean a task as had ever been undertaken by proposing to make a complete survey of the heavens. On March 13, 1781, he discovered an object which did not have quite the appearance of a star.
He thought at first that he had found a faint and distant comet, but computations proved it to be a planet more than twice as far from the sun as Saturn. “
The discovery made Herschel famous. He was appointed telescope-maker to the king and later was knighted,” we are told.
A messenger from the bridge comes in to tell us that we are approaching the planet, and so we go forward to the control room in the nose of the ship to get a good view from its plate glass windows.
Four moons revolve around Uranus. They have been named Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon. Titania, largest of the four, has a diameter of about 1,000 miles. The others are smaller.
Their names are poetic, recalling the fantastic stories of fairies and sprites. Good names, perhaps, for the satellites of a planet which looks as though it had been molded from cake icing.
We spiral around Uranus, studying its four moons. All of them are too small to have atmospheres. Then we spiral around Uranus. We do not risk entering the sea-green clouds, although we would like to know what gases are in them.
It is obvious that they must be gases which liquify at very low temperatures. Ammonia gas, we are certain, is among them. 
Out here in space, 1,782,300,000 miles from the sun, we reflect upon the gigantic size of our solar sys-tern. Somewhere, still farther from the sun, lies Neptune. It is another billion miles to the orbit of Neptune. And a billion miles beyond Neptune is the orbit of Pluto.
What lies beyond Pluto? Pickering thinks there still are other planets. Many astronomers, surprised by the small size of Pluto, have thought that it might only be one of a group resembling asteroids. 
Our chief navigator would like to explore the space beyond Uranus. We can not blame him, for undying fame awaits the man who can add another planet to the solar system.
But we have been traveling through space for a week. We have had a close view of the sea-green world and now we want to return to our own earth. And so we head for home.
Perhaps some day we shall board the rocket ship for another journey into space.
