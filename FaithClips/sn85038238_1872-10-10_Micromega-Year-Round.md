MICROMEGA.
In a recent issue, All the Year Round reproduces one of Voltaire's satirical stories, which, though written over a century ago, is just as readable, and probably as pointed in its wit and application today as when first published. The story is introduced in All the Tear Round by the following paragraph:
Francois-Marie Arouet, wit, poet, dramatist, historian, philosopher, satirist, speculator, man of science, man of affairs, man of gallantry - who made for himself the famous name Voltaire - found the wiseacres of the French Academy of Sciences droning off into the slumber of self-complacency. They had decided to their complete satisfaction that there were no other habitable worlds than ours, that there were no inhabitants of the world worth speaking of except Frenchmen, that there were no Frenchmen besides Parisians, and that there were no Parisians deserving mention outside the Academy. Voltaire put this stinging nettle into their bed:
In one of those huge planets which wheel around Sirius, the dog-star, there lived a very intelligent young man, whom I had the pleasure of meeting the last time he visited the little ant hill we call earth. He was called Micromega, a name which, for that matter, well expresses the comparative insignificance of all great people. He was twenty-four miles high. When I say twenty-four miles I mean it he measured a hundred and twenty thousand feet in his stockings.
Now place any geometrician in possession of this gentleman's height, and he will at once sit down and calculate; that since a globe of twenty-five thousand miles round produces a man of about five and a half feet high, the planet which Mr. Micromega inhabited must necessarily have a circumference just twenty-one millions six hundred thousand times greater than our tiny earth. Nature, you see, is orderly and proportionate in all her works.
Such being the height of his highness, an artist will readily ascertain that he must have measured fifty thousand feet round the waist whilst, since the nose is a third of the length of the human face, and the face again the seventh part of the height, it follows that the Sirian's nose must have measured nearly a mile and a half in length.
