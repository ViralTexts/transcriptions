Prof. Robert W. Wood, of the Johns Hopkins University, has perfected an invention, based on a discovery, that may revolutionize the present costly and cumbersome methods of studying the stars and exploring the universe for new planets, suns, moons and asteroids. Judging by the success the young scientist has had, the simplicity of the principle of his invention and the comparatively small cost of models, the possibilities of his telescope are commensurate to the scientific-literary visions of Mr. H. G. Wells, fictionist extraordinary.
 Since the invention of the telescope in the sixteenth century, it has been the dream of a great part of the scientific world to actually get a glimpse of the life that possibly exists on Mars and other planets; to secure, some tangible proof of intelligent existence on the worlds around us. 
But in Prof. Wood's telescope there is no glass! Its reflecting surface, its lens, is Mercury, revolving mercury, that magnifies and magnifies as the speed increases until it brings the havens down startlingly close. While Prof. Wood, like most scientists, is somewhat reticent about his invention, it is not hard to conclude from his remarks that he has great hope of its accomplishing astronomical wonder. From 'To See the Men on Mars," in February Technical World Magazine.
