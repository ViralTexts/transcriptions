Some astronomers have devoted special attention to counting the number of stars which may be seen with the naked eye, and the result has been that, even to persons gifted with more than ordinary powers of vision, there are not so many as 4,000 stars at any time visible above the horizon. But a very different result presents itself when the heavens are surveyed through a telescope. Countless numbers of stars then come into view which were previously invisible, and the more powerful the telescope used the greater the number of stars revealed to observation, until finally the conclusion is arrived at that the number of stars visible in the heavens is limited only by the optical capacity of the instrument which the observer may employ in his survey. A familiar illustration of this is furnished by the well-known group of stars known as the Pleiades. Surveyed with the naked eye, this interesting object is seen to consist of only some six or seven stars; but when observed with an ordinary opera glass the entire field of view is filled with a beautiful congeries of distinct stars The great astronomer, Sir William Herschel, who far surpassed other astronomers in the profundity of his explorations of the stellar heavens, has left upon record some striking results of his observations illustrative of the immense multitude of stars which a powerful telescope is capable of revealing. It may be proper to remark that when the stars are surveyed even with a telescope of moderate capacity, they are seen traveling in quick succession through the field of view of the instrument, an optical illusion attributable to the diurnal revolution of the earth upon its axis. Herschel, while engaged in surveying some regions of the Milky Way, found that in the short interval of a quarter of an hour as many as 116,000 stars passed through the field of his telescope. On another occasion he estimated that in 41 minutes there passed in review before him the immense number of 258,000 stars.
