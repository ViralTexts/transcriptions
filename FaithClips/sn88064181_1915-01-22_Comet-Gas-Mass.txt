It is suggested that some of the striking changes manifested by certain comets in executing their orbits are due to the fact that they encounter masses of gas in interplanetary space, and that they are not moving in a vacuum, says a writer in the Scientific American. If there are such gaseous masses, then in view of the inclinations and extent of their orbits, comets are peculiarly fitted to act as explorers, and there is every probability that they will sooner or later encounter such masses. The planets move in a narrow zone near the plane of the ecliptic, while the inclination of the cometary orbits is sometimes considerable, varying for the periodic comets from three degrees to 162 degrees. As a consequence, comets attain regions of the solar system, where no other bodies penetrate. Many phenomena seem to receive a satisfactory explanation if the existence of gaseous masses scattered through the solar system be admitted. These gaseous masses, probably of different chemical constitution, may be considered as the residue of the initial nebula, having escaped the phenomena of combustion which gave rise to the other members of the solar system.
