Pasted on page 26 of Franklin’s Ledger, 1764–1775, is a small slip of paper on which he wrote a memorandum which appears to have nothing to do with the accounts to which it has been attached. Although the memorandum as a whole is dated 1772, it is printed here at the date of the earliest item on it.
