Dear Sister,
London, Sept. 3. 1774
Hearing just now of this Opportunity, I write a Line to acquaint you that I am well and hearty, Thanks to God, as I hope you are.
It seems likely now that I shall stay here another Winter; you will therefore be kind in continuing to write to me. My Love to Jenney, &c. I am ever, Your affectionate Brother
B Franklin
