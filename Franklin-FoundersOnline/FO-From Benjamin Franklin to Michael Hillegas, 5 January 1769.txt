Sir:
London, Jan. 5, 1769.
I received yours of Nov. 3, and was very sorry to find you had been disappointed of your Glasses by their being broken in going over. I have given Orders to have the Loss repairâ€™d, agreeable to the Directions in your Letter, and hope it will not be long before they are executed. Make no Apology as if you gave me Trouble, for I assure you it is a Pleasure to me, when in my Power to do a Friend any little Service. With great regard, I am, Sir, Your most obedient, Humble Servant,
B. Franklin.
Mr. Hillegas.
