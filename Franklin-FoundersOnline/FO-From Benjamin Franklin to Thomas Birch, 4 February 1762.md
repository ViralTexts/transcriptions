Sir,
Craven-Street, Feb. 4, 1762.
Mr. Canton did me the favour to shew me the ingenious experiments he has described in the inclosed letter. They succeeded perfectly as he has related them; and I imagine, the communication of them must be agreeable to the curious in this branch of natural knowledge. I am, Sir, with great respect, your most obedient and most humble servant,
B. Franklin.
