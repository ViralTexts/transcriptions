Gentlemen,
Passy, July 11. 1781
I approve of your not having sent the Letters of Exchange which I formerly ordered. You will see by the enclos’d that Capt. Jackson desists from his Demand. Thus you have only to retain the Money till a fresh Order from the Minister permits your Parting with it. I have the honour to be Gentlemen Y.m.o. & m h S.
BF
Messrs Fizeaux & Grand.—
