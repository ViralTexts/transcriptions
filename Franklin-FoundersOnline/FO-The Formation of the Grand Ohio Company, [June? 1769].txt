The two documents that follow are closely connected. Both were products of the obscure and complicated process by which a group, known as the “suffering traders,” that claimed Indian lands west of the Alleghenies was transformed into an Anglo-American company with political influence and grandiose ambitions. Neither of the documents can be precisely dated. The first is a rough draft, in Franklin’s hand, of the organization of the Company; the second is a petition from it, which is endorsed as having been read before the Privy Council on July 24, 1769. The two were presumably composed at almost the same time.
The treaty signed at Fort Stanwix in November, 1768, provided for a large cession by the Indians of land south of the Ohio River to compensate the “suffering traders” for their earlier losses. The treaty was not valid until approved by the crown, and to secure approval William Trent and Samuel Wharton came to England early in 1769. Their consultations with Franklin and others soon convinced them that the best hope for the traders was to expand their group by including a number of Englishmen influential in politics, among them John Sargent and the Hon. Thomas Walpole. The idea had obvious advantages for both sides: the politicians acquired land claims that might mean riches; the Americans acquired the political support that they needed in order to get the Fort Stanwix agreement confirmed. The next step was to block out the structure of the new organization, which was officially known as the Grand Ohio Company, but also went by the name of the Walpole Company and, somewhat later, the Vandalia Company.
Franklin’s sketch of the articles of government reads as if they had been hammered out in a group discussion. Some of the marginal comments probably reflect his own ideas, some those of others at the meeting. In any case the articles were subject to further discussion through the rest of the year, and did not take final form until December.
The petition to the King raises a number of questions. The first is whether it was the only petition from the Company, or one of several at approximately the same period. Samuel Wharton, writing some years later, twice referred to a petition in June, 1769, that was signed by a small committee; at one time he listed the members as Franklin, Walpole, Sargent, and himself; at another time he added Thomas Pownall. Samuel Wharton and Franklin, writing in 1779, referred to a petition in June, 1769, that was signed by themselves on behalf of an Anglo-American group. In both cases the aim was the same as that of the petition below, to secure for the Company the right to buy 2,400,000 acres of American land. This evidence could be read to mean that three petitions asking for the same thing, each with a somewhat different list of signers, were submitted within a period of a few weeks; but such redundancy would have been absurd. We are convinced that all these references are to a single document, the one we print, and that the signers were the numerous names that appear there, and not the small committee Wharton mentioned, or Wharton and Franklin alone. Those two agree on the June date, which we have no reason to question and which is reasonable for a petition that reached the Privy Council in late July. The articles of organization preceded, as the first one makes clear, the drafting of the petition; and we believe that June was the most probable date for both.
