	On Monday last in the Forenoon a Fire broke out in a Pot-house near Walnut-Street; and the Weather having been extream dry a great while together, it burnt very furiously, and by the Flakes of burning Shingles that were carried thro’ the Air, several of the neighbouring Houses, and some at a considerable Distance were set on fire also. The Pot-House and a Carpenter’s Shop adjoining were both consumed; but by the Diligence and Activity of the People, and especially by the Assistance of the Engines, it was prevented from spreading further. It is thought by some that the Engines sav’d the Town several Thousand Pounds that Day. [April 18]

	Last Night a Fire broke out in a back Building behind Dr. Jones’s in Market-Street but was soon extinguish’d. It being difficult at first to get Water for the Engines, ’tis thought the Fire would have risen to a great Head there abouts, if so much Rain had not fallen Yesterday as made every Thing very wet. Where there is not Pumps in Yards, it is to be wish’d that People would keep Hogsheads of Water always ready for such Occasions, as they are obliged by Law to do in some Cities. [May 23]

[June 6]

	The Weather has been so excessive hot here for a Week past, that a great Number of People have fainted and fallen into Convulsions, and several have died in a few Hours after they were taken. From the Country round about we hear that a great many of the Harvest People faint in the Fields, and ’tis said that in some Places a multitude of Birds are found dead. Excepting the Hot Summer about 7 Years since, such Weather has not been known in this Country in the memory of Man. [July 11]

	By being too nice in the Choice of the little Pieces sent me by my Correspondents to be printed, I had almost discouraged them from writing to me any more. For the Time to come, and that my Paper may become still more generally agreeable, I have resolved not to regard my own Humour so much in what I print; and thereupon I give my Readers the two following Letters. [August 8]



	Last Saturday Morning died here, the Lady of our worthy Governor, at his Country-House near this City, after an Illness which for some Months past had seized her, tho’ she was confined to her Bed four days only before her Death: Her Corpse being brought to Town early on Sunday Morning was decently and honourably interred in our Church about Eight in the Evening. She was descended of an honourable Family in the Southern part of Scotland, which suffered much thro’ their too great Attachment to that unhappy Prince King James the Second: Her two Brothers bred up by their Father in the Protestant Religion, being afterwards seduced from it, the Eldest, dead some years since, held an high Office in the Court of the late Duke of Tuscany, and the other is now Confessor to His most Catholick Majesty. This Lady was much esteemed by all that knew her, for her solid good Sense, exemplary Piety and extensive Charity, in which last few were more private, or according to their Circumstances more bountiful to the unfortunate. She died a true Protestant of the Communion  of the Church of England, for which she had so great an Esteem and Veneration, that very advantageous Offers made to her by her Brothers could not draw her aside from a strict Adherence to the Principles of that excellent Church. Her Death is universally lamented here, and she has left behind her a numerous Family to deplore their irreparable Loss. [September 19]



	An Express from New-Castle having late last Thursday Night brought the agreeable News, that the Honourable John Penn, Esq; the eldest of our Proprietors, with his Brother-in-Law Mr. Freame, his Lady and Family were on board a Ship from London, then off New-Castle, and standing up this River; The Honourable Thomas Penn, Esq, with several Gentlemen of this City, hasted early next Morning to Chester (the late afflicting Loss in our Governor’s Family, preventing him from making one of the Number). Mr. Penn, Mr. Freame and his Lady came on Shore at that Place about Four in the Afternoon, and after passing that Night there, set out for this City about Nine in the Morning. They were met at Skuylkil River by several Ladies, who came to pay their Compliments to Mrs. Freame on her Arrival, and passing that Ferry, were received by the Mayor, Recorder, and Commonalty of the City, in whose Name the Recorder made the following Speech: [Text is not reproduced here]. Then proceeding forward with a Train of several Coaches, Chaises, and a very numerous Company on Horse-back, they were saluted at their Entrance into the City, with a Discharge of the Guns on Society-Hill, and afterwards by most of the Ships in our River; about Three in the Afternoon, they alighted at their Brother’s House, where an elegant Entertainment was provided for the Ladies, and also for the Gentlemen of the Council of this Province. [September 25]



	Yesterday Morning Michael Welfare, one of the Christian Philosophers of Conestogoe, appeared in full Market in the Habit of a Pilgrim, his Hat of Linnen, his Beard at full Length, and a long Staff in his Hand. He declared himself sent by Almighty God, to denounce Vengeance against the Iniquity and Wickedness of the Inhabitants of this City and Province, without speedy Repentance. The Earnestness of his Discourse, which continu’d near a quarter of an Hour; the Vehemence of his Action, and the Importance of what he delivered, commanded the Attention of a Multitude of People. And when he had finished he went away unmolested. [September 25]

Franklin
