Extracts from The Pennsylvania Gazette have been printed for each of the years that Franklin personally conducted his printing office (see above, I, 164). With the establishment of the partnership of Franklin and Hall on January 1, 1748, however, the latter took over the daily oversight of the office, though Franklin, of course, from time to time contributed both original essays and excerpts from private letters containing news of general interest. The extracts for 1747 are, therefore, the last group of unsigned miscellaneous items that will be printed at the end of the year in this work.

	   Last Saturday Evening a great Number of the Inhabitants of this City met at Mr. Walton’s School-House in Arch-street, when a Form of an Association for our common Security and Defence against the Enemy was consider’d and agreed to. On Monday following, the same was laid before a great Meeting of the principal Gentlemen, Merchants and others, at Roberts’s Coffee-House, where after due Deliberation, it was unanimously approv’d of, and another Meeting appointed to be the next Day following at the New-Building, in Order to begin Signing. Accordingly on Tuesday Evening upwards of Five Hundred Men of all Ranks subscribed their Names; and as the Subscription is still going on briskly in all Parts of the Town, ’tis not doubted but that in a few Days the Number will exceed a Thousand, in this City only, exclusive of the neighbouring Towns and Country. ’Tis hop’d the same laudable Spirit will spread itself throughout the Province; it being certain that we have Numbers more than sufficient, to defeat (with the Blessing of God) any Enterprize our Enemies can be suppos’d to form against us: All we wanted was Union and Discipline. The Form of the Association will be printed in our next; as also the Scheme of a Lottery for raising a Sum of Money for the general Service. [November 26]
