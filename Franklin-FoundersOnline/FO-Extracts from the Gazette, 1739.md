            We hear that Tuesday Night last, a young Dutchman was married to an old Dutchwoman, who was known to have Money. They had a Fiddle at the Wedding, and when the Bride was about to Dance, the Bridegroom told her he was oblig’d to go out a little Way and would return in a short Time. She danc’d ’till it was late, and then he not appearing, she went to look for him in the Bed-Chamber; where she found to her great Surprize that he had been and taken away her Money, and he has not since been heard of. [March 22]
          
          
            We hear from Pensoken, that on the first Inst. one John Collis, being reproach’d by his Acquaintance for suing a Debtor who was unable to pay him, was so stung with Remorse, that he went voluntarily into the River and drowned himself, in about two or three foot Depth of Water. [April 12]
          
          
            [Advertisement] Great Variety of Maps and Prints Sold by B. Franklin. [April 19]

            Yesterday one James Johnson, met a Man riding into Town, who (in Company with another Man, not yet taken) robb’d him in his Journey from North-Carolina to this Place of upwards of Three Hundred Pounds, Carolina Money, and a Note for Fifty Pounds Sterling; and laid hold of him: The Highwayman beg’d not to be expos’d, and pretended he had marry’d a rich Widow in Town, and would immediately refund the Money, if the other would go with him to his House; on this Pretence he led him to the outside of the Town, then leap’d on his Horse and made his Escape down to the Lower-Ferry, but finding himself closely pursued, and the Boat not ready to go over, he made into the Neck, where he was taken some Hours after; and after an Examination before a Magistrate, committed to Prison. [May 31]
          
          
            We are assur’d that the Man now in Prison in this City for a Robbery committed in Carolina, is the same, who under various Names has been guilty of a great Number of Cheats and Rogueries in this and the neighbouring Provinces for several Years past. [June 14]

            On the 30th of May past, the Children, Grand-Children and Great-Grand-Children of Richard Buffington, senior, to the Number of One Hundred and Fifteen, met together at his House in Chester County, as also his Nine Sons- and Daughters-in-law, and Twelve Great-Grand-Children-in-law.

              Mr. Franklin,
            
            The following is a Paragraph contain’d in a Letter I received lately from my Brother Thomas Bond, in Paris, dated Feb. 20. 1738, 9: As I think it will in no small Measure confirm the Character of the Seneca Snake-Root, set forth by Dr. Tennent, common Justice to that Gentleman obliges me to make it known to the Publick.
            
              Phineas Bond
            
          
          
            “The Seneca Snake-Root, was sent from Virginia to Mr. Jussieu, Physician and Professor of Botany to the King, with a Recommendation and the Method of Use in a Pleurisy, and has been frequently tried by him and many others in that Disorder with surprizing Success, and is in great Esteem: He is a Man of Great Reputation and Learning, and told me this himself.” [July 26]
          
          
            [Advertisement] A few Days past was lost, a Magnifying Glass set in a Cup of Wood about the Bigness of a Taylor’s Thimble. The Finder shall be well rewarded upon bringing or sending it to the Printer. [August 2]
