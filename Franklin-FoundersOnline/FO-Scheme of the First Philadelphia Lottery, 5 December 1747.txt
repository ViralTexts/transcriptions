The most urgent problem for the Association was not armed men, but money. Volunteering for military service, especially when there was no likelihood of being called to duty unless one’s own city was actually threatened, was one thing; it was another to make a free gift of money to buy supplies. Franklin’s solution was a lottery. Managers were appointed; the Mayor and Corporation of the city gave their approval and appointed overseers; Franklin ran off a thousand handbills of the scheme and printed 10,000 tickets for the drawings. The Gazette announced on December 3 that the Scheme of the Lottery would be published “on Saturday next” (i.e., December 5) and that copies might be had gratis at the post office; and the next week the Gazette reprinted it. To give the public confidence Franklin prepared a precise explanation of its operation (see below, p. 229). James Logan put £250 into the lottery; the city of Philadelphia bought 200 tickets; the Hand-in-Hand Fire Company took 100. The managers sent them for sale to Maryland, Virginia, New York, and New Jersey. The Philadelphians, Franklin boasted, came as near to selling out in seven weeks as New York and New England lotteries did in as many months.
The lottery was designed to raise £20,000, of which £3000 was to go to the Association. The drawings were held between February 8 and 17. William Allen, for example, won £312; the city of Philadelphia £262; both turned back their prizes, as did Franklin, who drew several small prizes totaling £12.
Meanwhile the Mayor and Corporation of the city and the President and Council of the province had petitioned the Proprietors for cannon, arms, and ammunition. The Lottery Managers ordered cannon from London and made a census of what was available on the city wharves, locating nearly 70 of different sorts. On December 29 the Council appealed to Governor Shirley of Massachusetts and Governor Clinton of New York to borrow guns from those colonies; they made similar requests of the governor of Jamaica and the commander-in-chief at Cape Breton. Shirley replied that he had none to spare, but promised to send a guardship to watch Delaware Bay and River. Clinton at first made a similar reply. But the Pennsylvania Council renewed their plea in March 1748, sending two of their members, Abraham Taylor, colonel of the Associators, and Thomas Lawrence, with William Allen and Franklin, to New York to present it in person. Clinton again refused them, “but,” Franklin remembered, “at a Dinner with his Council where there was great Drinking of Madeira Wine, as the Custom  at that Place then was, he soften’d by degrees, and said he would lend us Six. After a few more Bumpers he advanc’d to Ten. And at length he very good-naturedly conceded Eighteen.”
From the income from the lottery the managers, together with a committee appointed for the purpose, defrayed the mounting costs of defense. Though not a lottery manager, Franklin was a member of the committee. By virtue of their control of funds these men became the principal figures in the Association. They selected a site for a strong battery on William Allen’s land below Gloria Dei Church at Wicaco, south of the city, and a smaller one of eleven guns on William Atwood’s wharf under Society Hill, and considered constructing similar works on other wharves. Planking and other materials were ordered in January; by early spring the Wicaco battery, 400 feet long, was ready for cannon. Those from New York arrived in April. John Stamper seems to have been in charge of construction. Much of the work mounting the guns was done by John Pass, and old Gustavus Hesselius earned £4 painting the gun carriages, possibly with stripes and coats of arms. A flagpole was erected at a cost of £2 11s. It was, the Council informed the Proprietors in July, “one of the compleatest Batteries, of its size, on the Continent.” At Wicaco, Franklin wrote, “the Associators kept a nightly Guard while the War lasted: And among the rest I regularly took my Turn of Duty there as a common Soldier.”
The Lottery Managers’ journal and ledger, with some related papers, are in the Yale University Library. From these the Managers published in 1752 a full accounting of their expenditures in a small pamphlet entitled Philadelphia Lottery Accounts.
