London, Jan. 11. 1758.
I thank you for your Account of the Aurora. A very considerable one appearâ€™d here the same Evening, being Saturday, Nov. 12. I did not see it, but have heard of it from several. If it was the same that you saw; it must have been very high, or very extensive, as the two Places are 1000 Leagues asunder.
