In the issue of May 26–29, 1759, The London Chronicle announced that An Historical Review of the Constitution and Government of Pensylvania was “This day published.” So appeared at last a work with which Franklin had been long and closely concerned. The main part of the book consists of a 380-page narrative of the colony’s political history from the granting of the royal charter to William Penn in 1681 to the end of September 1756. It includes, in full or in extract, many of the messages exchanged between the governors and the Assembly, organized and presented in such a way as to emphasize the allegedly selfish and arbitrary policies of the Proprietors and their deputies and to justify the Assembly’s position in the long series of disputes that had taken place. At the end there appears, in sixty-four pages of fine print, an appendix “containing sundry Original Papers” relating to these controversies. Among these are the Proprietors’ Answer to the Assembly’s Representation and the Assembly Committee’s Report on the Answer, Sept. 11, 1753 (above, V, 42–57); the Assembly Committee’s eloquent Report on the Governor’s Instructions, Sept. 23, 1756 (above, VI, 515–31); William Franklin’s letter to The Citizen, Sept. 17, 1757 (above, VII, 258–63), and Thomas Penn’s estimate of the value of the proprietary estates and revenues, with remarks on the estimate. The whole work was a major propaganda effort to win support, especially in Great Britain, for the Assembly in its protracted conflict with the Proprietors.
At the time and for many years afterwards, Franklin was generally regarded as the author of the Historical Review, but it has long been recognized that, although he and his son William supplied many of the materials, the actual writer was Richard Jackson. Franklin repeatedly denied authorship and was even a little apologetic to Norris for some of the expressions in the book, saying he “was not permitted to alter every Thing [he] did not fully approve.” In discussing it with David Hume, Sept. 27, 1760, he stated specifically that it “was not written by me, nor any Part of it, except the Remarks on the Proprietor’s Estimate of his Estate, and some of the inserted Messages and Reports of the Assembly which I wrote when at home, as a Member of Committees appointed by the House for that Service; the rest was by another Hand.” The Assembly “Messages and Reports” to which he referred have all been printed in earlier volumes of this edition; the “Remarks on the Proprietor’s Estimate” are printed below, preceded, in order to make them intelligible, by the Estimate itself.
The authenticity of the Penn Estimate has been sharply challenged. In a study of the proprietary system in Pennsylvania, William R. Shepherd pointed out that “No authentic document of this origin or nature is known to exist,” and added that the only direct reference to it or to Franklin’s remarks on it to be found among the Penn Manuscripts is in a letter from Thomas Penn to Richard Peters, May 18, 1767, in which the Proprietor declared: “It is quite impossible that Mr. Franklin’s accounts can have any foundation.” Shepherd strongly implied, but without directly saying so, that Franklin was guilty of outright forgery, and that he based the alleged Estimate either on his own knowledge of the procedures in the Pennsylvania Land Office or on information supplied by others in the colony. Shepherd pointed out, further, that the figures in the Estimate are greatly in excess of those found in other, more reliable records.
The present editors have been unable either to prove or to disprove the authenticity of the Penn Estimate, though it is clear that if it was a forgery Franklin was not the author. Writing to Joseph Galloway, Sept. 16, 1758, he acknowledged receipt of the paper and declared that it would “be of good Use.” Isaac Norris knew it had been sent to Franklin and he referred to its contents in a letter written a few days after the Historical Review was published. Obviously the paper was sent to Franklin from Pennsylvania as part of the “ammunition” his backers were supplying him for his assault on the Proprietors, and there seems no reason to believe that either Franklin or Jackson suspected its authenticity. Who wrote it, if it was a forgery, or how Franklin’s Pennsylvania friends got hold of it, if it was genuine, remains unknown. In any case, the remarks on the Estimate are clearly by Franklin and so are included here among his papers.
 

The Proprietaries have for a long Series of Years made a great Secret of the Value of their Estate and Revenue: By Accident the following authentic Paper is fallen into our Hands, and will serve as a Groundwork, on which the Reader may be enabled to form some Idea of the Value of that Estate in Pensylvania. It is a Copy of an original Paper drawn by Mr. Thomas Penn himself many Years ago, and endors’d
  “My Estimate of the Province, T Penn.”

The above Paper has no Date, but by sundry Circumstances in it, particularly there being no Value put on the Thirds of the Bank Lots, because they were not then fallen in; and by the Valuation put on the Lands (which is very different from their present Value) it must have been drawn while Mr. Thomas Penn resided in Pensylvania, and probably more than Twenty Years ago; Since which Time a vast Addition has been made to the Value of the Reserved Lands, and a great Quantity of Land has been disposed of, perhaps equal to all preceding.
We must therefore add to the above Sum of £252,122 2s. 0d. the following Articles, viz.

   *The Lots of Land within the Plan of the Town were originally promis’d to be given to the Purchasers of Land in the Country. But that has been long since discontinued; and for many Years past the Proprietor has shut the Office, and forbid his Agents even to sell any more of them; intending to keep them all, till he can let them out on high Ground Rents, or on Building Leases. 500 Acres divided into House Lots, and dispos’d of in this Manner, will alone make a vast Estate. The old Proprietor likewise in his Plan of the City, laid out five large Squares, one in each Quarter, and one in the Centre of the Plan, and gave the same to the Inhabitants for publick Uses. This he publish’d in all his Accounts of the Country, and his Papers of Invitation and Encouragement to Settlers; but as no formal Deed or Conveyance of those Squares is now to be found, the present Proprietor has resum’d them, turn’d them again into private Property that the Number of his Lots may be increas’d; and his Surveyor General in his lately publish’d Plan of the City, has conceal’d all those Squares by running intended Streets over them. A Proceeding equally odious to the People, and dishonourable to the Family!

  Thus far for the present Value of what was then estimated, But since that Time, very great Quantities of Land have been sold, and several new Manors laid out and reserv’d; one of which, viz. that of Conedoguinet is said to contain 30,000 Acres: The Quantity sold since the Estimate, must be at least equal to what was sold before, as the People are doubled, and the Manors probably equal in Quantity: We may therefore suppose, that a fair Estimate of the Lands sold, Rents and Manors reserved, and new Towns laid out into Lots, since the above Estimate, would be at least equal to it, that is another Tenth, and amount also to £573,697 2s. 0d.

  For the Three Fifths of all Royal Mines, and One Fifth of all other Mines reserv’d to these Lords Proprietors, we can as yet estimate no Sum, and must leave it a Blank as we find it; but since in the Ridges of Mountains not yet settled, some very valuable Specimens of Ores have been found by Travellers, it is not unlikely this Article may in Time become considerable beyond Computation.
}






  For the Offices we shall likewise make no Estimation, tho’ they are greatly increas’d in Number and Value, with the Increase of People; as we believe the Proprietaries do not raise immediate Money from the Grants of those Offices at present, they being chiefly dispos’d of to bribe or reward their Partisans and Favourites; in which however they may find their Account.
}





  For the Escheats we likewise add nothing; for tho’ it is thought a valuable Article, we have no Information on which we can form any Judgment concerning its Value, it must however be continually increasing.
}





  There is another Article, we are greatly at a Loss about, which is the Interest of Money arising to the Proprietors from Securities on Lands possess’d by Persons unable to make present Payment. These pay not only Quitrent for the Land but Interest for the Purchase Money. This Interest
   *See Fisher’s Account hereafter.
 is thought to be a very considerable Income, but we cannot estimate it.
}





  The Three Lower Counties on Delaware, which are a distinct Territory and Government from the Province of Pensylvania, and held by a different Title, are also a very valuable Part of the Proprietary Estate; tho’ what Value should be put on the same is at present difficult to say.

In Sterling, about Ten Millions!
But on the whole, it appears pretty clearly, that deducting all the Articles containing the Valuation of Lands yet unsold, and unappropriated within their Patent, and the Manors and Rents to be hereafter reserv’d, and allowing for any small over-Valuations in their present reserv’d Lands and Incomes [tho’ ’tis thought if any be it will not be found to exceed the under-Valuation in other Instances] there cannot remain less than a Million of Property which they now at this Time have in Pensylvania.
And in that Province there are but 20,000 Families, to each of which, one with another, there does not belong more than £300 of Property, if so much; which multiply’d by 20,000 gives £6,000,000 for the whole Property of the People there.
The Proprietaries then have in present Possession a Property there at least equal to one sixth of That of the People. They ought therefore to pay the same Proportion of the Taxes.
That the Reader may form some Judgment of the Profits made by this Monopoly of Land in America in Favour of the House Of Penn, we shall just mention, that the Land is first purchased of the Indians, and none but the Proprietors are allow’d to purchase of the Indians within the Limits of their Grant: The Indians of late Years have somewhat rais’d their Price; and for the last great Purchase in 1754, which was of about Seven Millions of Acres, they demanded (how much do you think?) no less than 2000 Dollars amount at Seven and Sixpence Currency each, to Seven Hundred and Fifty Pounds.

But the Indian Council at Onondago not being satisfied with the sale of so much Land at once, the Proprietors have since been obliged to disgorge a Part of the Hunting Country they had not paid for, and reconvey the same to the Indians, who, when they are dispos’d to sell it, may possibly demand 2000 Dollars more, for which the above Account must then have Credit.
One would think that where such good Bargains are bought of the poor Natives, there should be no Occasion for fraudulent Art to over-reach them, in order to take more than is granted: And that if a War occasion’d by such Injuries should be drawn upon the innocent Inhabitants, those who were the Cause of the War, if they did not, as in Justice they ought, bear the whole Expence of it, at least they would not refuse to bear a reasonable Part. Whether this has ever been the Case is now a Subject of Publick Enquiry.
But let us see how the Land bought in such lumping Pennyworths of the Natives by the Monopolist, is huckster’d out again to the King’s Subjects. To give the Reader some Idea of this, after remarking that £15 10s. 0d. per Hundred Acres for wild Land, is three Times dearer than the Proprietor of Maryland’s Price, and ten Times dearer than his Majesty’s Lands in Virginia and Carolina, both as good if not better Countries, we shall present him with a genuine Account, stated under the Hand of the Proprietor’s Receiver General, obtain’d with great Difficulty by the Purchaser of two Tracts of Land, some Time after he had paid his Money; when on more particular Consideration of the Sum paid compar’d with the Quantity bought, he imagin’d he had paid too much. The Account is as follows, viz.

“In Feb. 1747, John Fisher obtained a Proprietary Patent for the Lands above mentioned. But by the Accompts then exhibited to him, and which he paid, he was charged on Job’s Right £141 4s. 8d. which is £67 8s. 1d. more than the above Account, and also was charged on Coopers Right, £70 18s. 11d., which is £24 3s. 3¾d. more than the above Accompt of Cooper’s. So that by the two Accompts it is supposed he has paid £91 11s. 4¾d. more than could legally be received from him.

“The Reason of such great Difference in the Accompts are as follow, viz.
“1st That Interest has been charged on the Consideration Money for Job’s Land, for 10 Years and 18 Days before the Land was survey’d.
“2d That Quitrent has also been charged for that Time at 85 per Cent.
“3d That the Principle and Interest to the Time of Warrant and Survey were added together, and that Interest was charged for that Total to the Time the Patent was granted.
“4th That Interest has been charged on the Consideration Money for Cooper’s Land, for 5y. 10 m. 8 d. before the Land was survey’d.
“5th That Quitrent has also been charged for that Time at 85 per Cent.
“6th That the Principle and Interest to the Time of Warrant and Survey were added, and Interest charged for that Total to the Time the Patent was granted, which is compound Interest.”
To these Remarks of the Accountant we shall only add, That the Price of Exchange between Philadelphia and London is not fix’d, but rises and falls according to the Demand for Bills; That 85 per Cent. charg’d for the Exchange in this Account is the highest Exchange that perhaps was ever given in Pensylvania, occasion’d by some particular Scarcity of Bills at a particular Time; That the Proprietor himself in his Estimate reckons the Exchange but at 65, which is indeed near the Medium, and this Charge is 20 per Cent. above it. That the Valuing the Currency of the Country according to the casual Rate of Exchange with London, is in itself a false Valuation, the Currency not being really depreciated in Proportion to an occasional Rise of Exchange; since every Necessary of Life is to be purchas’d in the Country, and every Article of Expence defray’d by that Currency (English Goods only excepted) at as low Rates after as before such Rise of Exchange; That therefore the Proprietor’s obliging those who purchase of him to pay their Rents according to the Rate of Exchange is unjust, the Rate of Exchange including withal the Risque and Freight on remitting Money to England; and is besides a dangerous Practice, as the great Sums to be yearly remitted to him, put it in the Power of his own Agents to play Tricks with the Exchange at Pleasure, raise it at the Time of Year when they are to receive the Rents, by buying a few Bills at a high Price, and afterwards lower it by refraining to buy till they are sold more reasonably.
By this Account of the Receiver General’s, it appears we have omitted two other Articles in the Estimation of the Proprietary Estate, viz.


For the Quitrents of Lands many Years before they are granted!

  For the Interest of the Purchase-Money many Years before the Purchases are made!

On what Pretence these Articles of Charge are founded, how far they may be extended, and what they may amount to, is beyond our Knowledge; we are therefore obliged to leave them blank till we can obtain more particular Information.
