My dear Child,Passy, Jany. 7. 1783.
I received some time since, and sent to your Father, the Samples you had sent to me of your Drawing, particularly the Copy of the Print of your Grand Father, which appear’d to be well done.

I have also just now receiv’d your Letter written to wish me a happy New Year; but you should nevertheless have put a Date to it, and to all your Letters. It was accompanied with several to your other Friends, all without Dates. I shall forward them by the first Opportunity.
You should also, when you write, acknowledge the Receipt of Letters that have come to your Hands, mentioning their Dates. I sent you some time ago a Parcel containing several English Books, and I have not yet heard that you receiv’d them.
I am glad to learn that you have obtain’d another Prize. Present my best Respects to Madam Cramer, & to Mr & Made. Marignac. I am ever, Your affectionate Grandfather
B Franklin
Mr. Benja. F. Bache
