Dear Sir,
Passy, May 9th. 1779.
I received yours with a Copy of the Resolution of the 26th past which gave me a great deal of Pleasure. If one Nicholas Davis, who lodges in the Warmoes Straat Amsterdam, at the House of Jan Hendrik Cons√©, should apply to you for Assistance as an American, I desire you to take no Notice of him for he has already cheated us of considerable Sums.
I am ever, Yours affectionately
B Franklin
M. Dumas.
