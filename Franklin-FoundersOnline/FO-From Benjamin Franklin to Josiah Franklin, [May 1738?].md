            Honoured Father
            [May? 1738]
          
          I received your kind Letter of the 4th of May in answer to mine of April 13. I wrote that of mine with a Design to remove or lessen the Uneasiness you and my Mother appear’d to be under on Account of my Principles; and it gave me great Pleasure when she declar’d in her next to me that she approv’d of my Letter and was now satisfy’d with me.
