Dear sir
Passy, feb. 15. 1780
In Answer to yours relating to Capt. Cook, this may inform you that I sent Copies of the Enclosâ€™d to all the American Cruizers then in the Ports of france and spain with orders to our Agents to communicate them to others that might touch there. I also sent it to holland to be printed in the Dutch Papers, as a means of making it more generally known to our Cruizers at sea, who might find it in those Papers in their Examination of neutral Vessels. It was accordingly printed there. I cannot now readily find one of Those Papers.
I think I Saw it also in some of the English Papers. With great Esteem, I am, sir, Your most obedient and most humble servant
BF.
Mr. Digges.
