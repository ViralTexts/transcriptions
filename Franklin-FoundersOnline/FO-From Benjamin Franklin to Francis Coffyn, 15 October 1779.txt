SirPassy, Oct. 15. 1779.
Inclosed I Send you the Commissions desired for the Black Prince and The Black Princess. You will be so good as to fill up the Blanks properly and take the Bonds from the Parties, of which I Send one only, not having time to copy it: but that may be done with you for the other Vessel. I have the honour to be Sir &c.

M. Coffin.
