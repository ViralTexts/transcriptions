Dear sir
Passy June 2. 1779.
I know no more than you the Reasons of the Change respecting the Marquis But suppose they are good ones. I have no new Instructions to give. Perhaps you will receive some Instruction of the Kingâ€™s Pleasure. I can only wish you Health and success, being ever, with great and Sincere Esteem Dear sir y. &c.
Capt. Jones.
