            Wednesday last a Fire broke out in the Roof of a House in Second Street near the Church, but there being sufficient Help at hand, it was presently extinguished. Axes were observ’d to be of great Use; for when Holes were made in the Shingling, the Water from Engines and Buckets readily enter’d, and did ten times the Service it could otherwise have done.

            We have the Pleasure to inform our Readers that the News brought hither by two (seeming) Gentlemen from Virginia, of Georgia’s being taken (as mention’d in our last) proves not true; a Vessel being arriv’d at New-York in 11 Days from thence, and left all well there. ’Tis pity that any Persons who make the Appearance of Men of Credit, should, as they travel, think it a proper Diversion in such Times as these, to amuse their Countrymen with false Reports, which may prove in many Cases of very pernicious Consequence.

            Last Week a Dutch Waggoner who had wilfully driven over a Chair, in which were two young Women, and a Boy that was unwell, whereby the Child’s Scull was fractured, so that his Life is despaired of, was apprehended and committed to the Goal of this City.

            The same Day [Monday last], Michael Milchdeberger, the Dutch Waggoner, who drove his Wagon over a Chair, by which a Boy was wounded so that he died, was burnt in the Hand, the Jury having brought in their Verdict Manslaughter. [November 8]
          
          
            A Caution to the Publick.
            Last Saturday several counterfeit One Shilling Bills of New-Jersey were uttered here. The Paper is pretty stiff and good, and some of the Bills have an Impression of a Sage Leaf, ill done, upon their Backs. If these Bills are compared with the True Ones, both being fair, many Variations may be observed both in the Signing and the Printing, as the Counterfeits are a very bad Imitation of the True. Those who have not both Sorts to look at together, may take notice, that the Figures that make the Ornament or Border at the Bottom of the False Bills, which have a Resemblance of a Flower de Luce at Top, and something more under, stand apart, which in the True Bills stand close; and that in the False Bills the first I in the Word Shilling, that ends the Bill, is shorter than the last I in that Word; that the second L in the same Word is shorter than the first, and that the G is longer than the other Capitals, and made very open. [November 15]
          
          
            Just Published, and to be sold by the Printer hereof, the following Books, viz.
            I. The Fourth Edition, of A Preservative from the Sins and Follies of Childhood and Youth, written by way of Question and Answer. To which are added, some Religious and Moral Instructions, in Verse. By I. Watts, D.D. Price 8d.
            II. An Account of the New-Invented Pennsylvanian Fire-Places: Wherein their Construction and Manner of Operation is particularly explained; their Advantages above every other Method of warming Rooms demonstrated; and all Objections that have been raised against the Use of them answered and obviated. With Directions for putting them up, and for using them to the best Advantage. And a Copper-Plate, in which the several Parts of the Machine are exactly laid down, from a Scale of equal Parts. Price 1s.
            III. Poor Richard’s Almanack, for the Year 1745.
            Of whom also may be had, to compleat Gentlemen’s Setts, the American Magazine for April, 1744. [November 15]
          
          
            [Advertisement] Just Imported, And to be sold by Lewis Evans in Strawberry Alley. Price 1s. a Cake.
            Fine Crown Soap, For the Washing of fine Linen, Muslins, Laces, Silks, Chinces, Calicoes, and for the Use of Barbers.
            It cleanses fine Linnen, Muslins, Laces, Chinces, &c. with Ease and Expedition, which often suffers more from the long and hard rubbing of the Washer through the ill Qualities of the Soap they use, than the Wearing. It is excellent for the Washing of Scarlets, or any other bright and curious Colours, that are apt to Change by the Use of common Soap. The Sweetness of the Flavour renders it pleasant for the Use of Barbers. [November 15]
          
          
            [Advertisement] Saturday next will be published and sold by B. Franklin, The Pocket Almanack, for the Year 1745. [December 6]
          
          
            Whereas the Nossels of most of the Pumps in Market Street, and several other Streets of this City, were taken out and carried away, on Saturday-night the 24th of this Instant, and at several Times before, by some evil-minded, dissolute Persons; which might have been of most pernicious Consequence, if Fire had happened to break out before they could have been renewed. The Union Fire-Company of Philadelphia, do hereby offer a Reward of FIVEPounds to him or her who shall discover (so that they may be convicted at the Mayor’s Court) any of the Persons concern’d in removing the said Nossels, or doing any other Damage to the Pumps in the Streets, whereby they may be render’d incapable of discharging Water.
            By Order of the Company, Rees Meredith, Clerk[December 14]
