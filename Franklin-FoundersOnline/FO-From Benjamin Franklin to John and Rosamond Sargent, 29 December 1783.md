            Passy, Dec. 29. 1783
          
          You cannot conceive, my dear Friends, how happy your kind Letters make me. To find that throâ€™ all the unpleasant Circumstances that so long have separated us, you still retain your ancient Regard for me, gives me a Pleasure inexpressible. A Thousand Thanks for your hearty Invitation to your House. I am sure I can be no where happier, than with a Family I so much love. Whether I can come over in the Spring, is yet uncertain, but it is very certain that I long exceedingly to see & embrace you all; being ever, my dear Friends, Yours most affectionately
          
            B Franklin
            Mr & Mrs Sargent
