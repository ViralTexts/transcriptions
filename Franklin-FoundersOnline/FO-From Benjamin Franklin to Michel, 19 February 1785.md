					Sir,
					Passy, Feb. 19. 1785.
				
				The Humanity you have shown to that miserable young Female, Elizabeth Tingis, is very laudable, notwithstanding the Depravity of her Character. If it be true that she is of a respectable Family in America, there can be no doubt but they will repay the Expence with Thanks; but I never knew there any Family of that Name, and I question her being an American; I rather think she may be one of the late Emigrants from Ireland or Britain; and I think the Captain who brought her should be oblig’d to pay the Expence she has occasion’d, and take her away with him. I have the honour to be, Sir,
				
					M. Michel P. du Roy de l’Amirauté, à le Havre
