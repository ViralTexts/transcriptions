Dear Sir,
Passy, Decr. 4. 1780.
I am honoured with yours of the 24th. past. I have delivered your Letters to the M. de Castries & M. de Chaumont, and shall strongly sollicit the Payment of the Prize money, which I understand is not yet received from the King. I hope soon to see an End of that Affair, which has met with so many unaccountable Obstructions.— I enclose Dispatches for Congress which are to be sunk in case of Danger. I wish you to make the best of your Way to America, & that you may have a prosperous Voyage, being with great Esteem, Dear Sir, Your most Obedt & most humble Servt
B Franklin
Honble. Comme Jones
