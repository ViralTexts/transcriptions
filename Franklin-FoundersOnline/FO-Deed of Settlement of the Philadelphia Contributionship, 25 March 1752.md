In 1750 Franklin, Philip Syng, and Hugh Roberts had led the Union Fire Company (see above, II, 150) in an abortive effort to raise an insurance fund “to make up the Damage that may Arise by Fire among this Company.” Articles were drafted and discussed; Franklin had them engrossed; and in November they were submitted to the Company and signed. The scheme rested on too narrow a basis, however; it was abandoned almost at once; and nothing more is known about it.
The next year the plan was enlarged to include the other fire companies. On July 26, 1751, Franklin submitted a proposal to the Union Company “relating to the consideration of the late scheme for Insurance of Houses … Requesting that the Company would appoint two of their Members to attend such Persons as may be appointed by the other Several Fire Companies to meet at the Standard in Market Street on the 7th day of the 7th Month [September 7], to Consider such Matters as they may think will Tend Most to the Utility of the Inhabitants in General.” Franklin and Syng were appointed from the Union.
A broad plan was drafted, probably based on the articles of the London Amicable Contributionship for Insuring Houses from Loss by Fire, familiarly known as the Hand-in-Hand Company; and Feb. 4, 1752, a meeting was announced in the Pennsylvania Gazette, summoning the subscribers to the Philadelphia plan to meet “in order to agree on proper measures for carrying the same into execution.” Within two weeks Lewis Evans had engrossed the articles and “all persons inclined to subscribe” to the Philadelphia Contributionship for the Insurance of Houses from Loss by Fire, were called on to do so. Each subscriber signed the articles; the first to do so was Governor Hamilton, the second Franklin.
The Deed of Settlement called on the subscribers to meet on April 13 to elect directors and a treasurer; and the directors in turn elected Franklin as their president, a post he filled for two years, though he was often absent during his second term. The directors ordered Philip Syng, May 11, 1752, to make a seal for the company, showing “four Hands united”—whence the insurance company’s familiar Philadelphia name of the Hand-in-Hand; they asked Franklin, May 23, 1752, “to get a sufficient number of Policies printed”; and directed him, Dec. 24, 1753, to print in the Gazette a warning to policy holders that the company would not make good damage to their own houses or stores, “if any such damage arises to such houses or stores, by the breaming of ships at their wharves, or by gunpowder stored in their buildings, contrary to the good and wholesome laws of this province.” Franklin, of course, insured his own property; two of his early policies are numbered 19 and 20.
