Dear sir,
Passy, March 4. 1780.
You will see by the enclos’d that a Demand is made of replacing the Things belonging to The Serapis which Comme. Jones borrowed from her and took on board the Alliance when he changed ships. I request you to manage this affair with him in your usual Prudence. I am ever, my Dear friend, Yours most affectionately.
Dr. Bancroft L’orient.
