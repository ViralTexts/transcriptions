Sir
Paris, March 29. 1777.
The Bearer, Monsr. Dorcet, is extreamly desirous of entring into the American Service, and goes over at his own Expence, contrary to my Advice (as I apprehend you have already more foreign Officers than you can possibly employ) and without the smallest Expectation given him by me of his obtaining a Place in our Army. This at least shows a Zeal for our Cause that merits some Regard. He is recommended to me by the Count de Clermont-Tonnerre, Lieut. General, and Son of the premier Marechal de France; whose Letter I enclose. I therefore take the Liberty of introducing him to your Excellency; and that is all I presume to do, knowing myself to be no Judge of military Merit, if I were otherwise acquainted with the Gentleman. With the greatest Esteem and Respect, I have the Honour to be, Your Excellencyâ€™s most obedient and most humble Servant
B Franklin
His Excy. Gen. Washington
