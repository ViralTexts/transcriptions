Sir,
Passy, Augt. 22. 1781
The Congress having judged that the private Trade carried on with England under various Pretences, is prejudicial to the general Interest of the United States, and having lately passâ€™d several strong Resolutions for preventing it; I cannot presume to give any Countenance to it by the Passport you desire.
I have the honour to be Sir,
Mr. Peter Blake, Mercht. London
