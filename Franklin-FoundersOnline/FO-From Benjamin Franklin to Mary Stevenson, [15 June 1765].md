[June 15, 1765]
Mr. Franklin did not know of the Message this Morning till the Servant was gone; he has since been ready to beat Mrs. Stevenson for declining any Occasion (especially so joyful an one) of meeting the good Family of Kensington. Having made up the Quarrel, they now jointly beg to be favourâ€™d with the Company of that Family this Day in
Cravenstreet, June 15.
