Dear Sister,
London, Feb. 26. 1775
I hope you continue well, as I do, Thanks to God. Be of good Courage. Bad Weather does not last always in any Country. Supposing it may be agreable to you, I send you a Head they make here and sell at the China Shops. My Love to your Children, and to Cousin Williams and Family. I am ever Your affectionate Brother
B Franklin
