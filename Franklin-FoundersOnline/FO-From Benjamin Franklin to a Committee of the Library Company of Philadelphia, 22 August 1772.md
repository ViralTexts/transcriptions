Gentlemen,
London, Augt. 22. 1772
I received your Bill on Whitmore for £125 Sterling, which is carried to the Credit of the Library Company. With this you will receive the Books, of which inclosed I send the Invoice. I hope they will come safe to hand, and please. The Journals of the House of Commons are not to be had at present under 25 Guineas, or £25, therefore I did not think it adviseable to send them, as at Auctions or Sales one has frequent Opportunities of purchasing them much lower. Besides they are Books rather to be consulted on Occasion than read, and any one having such Occasion may find them in the Assembly’s Library. I will however send them if you direct me to do it. With great Regard, I am, Gentlemen, Your most obedient humble Servant
B Franklin
Messrs. Robt. Strettel Jones, Saml Rhoads, and Josiah Hewes
