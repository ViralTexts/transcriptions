Sir,
Passy, Sept. 22. 1780.
In mine of the 11th. Instant, I desired you to Ship any Cannon that might be in your hands, on board the marquis de la Fayette. I am since informed, that you have 28 Eighteen Pounders, & 28. Twenty four Pounders. As I owe to M. de Chaumont 28 Eighteen Pounders, to replace an equal Number of the same bore which with others, he advanced to me at lâ€™Orient to ballast the Alliance, this is to request that those 28. Eighteen Pounders in your Hands may be delivered for his account to Messrs. S. Jauge & Fils. The twenty four Punders, are to go in the Vessel, as per my last.
I have the Honour to be &c.
M. Bondfield
