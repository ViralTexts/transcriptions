The Mutiny Act passed on April 15, 1756 (see above, VI, 434–7), expired by its own limitation on October 30. Two days before that event Franklin brought in a bill, by leave of the House, to renew the law for a short term. With nearly a minimum of debate in the Assembly and discussion with the governor the bill was enacted on November 4. Except for the substitution of Denny’s name for that of Morris in the enacting clause, the law was identical with the one it succeeded down to the final sentence of the first act, which specified its terminal date. That sentence was omitted and the paragraphs printed below were substituted. The identical portion is not reprinted here.
