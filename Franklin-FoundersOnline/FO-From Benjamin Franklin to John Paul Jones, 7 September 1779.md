You will do your utmost to render the Service therein mentioned effectual, which will in the present Circumstances be very advantageous to the common Cause, and very acceptable to his Majesty. It will be well to keep your Intention of convoying those Vessels as secret as possible, lest Notice should be sent of it to England, & Ships placed to intercept you.
