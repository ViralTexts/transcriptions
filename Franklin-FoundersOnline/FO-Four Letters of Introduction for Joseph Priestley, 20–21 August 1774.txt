In late August Joseph Priestley left with his patron, Lord Shelburne, for a Continental tour. It included the Low Countries and the Rhineland and ended in October in Paris, where Priestley demonstrated some of his experiments with gases and discussed them with Lavoisier in the first meeting between those two giants of chemistry. Franklin gave Priestley introductions to Dubourg, two Dutch academics of his acquaintance, and the secretary of the Batavian Society of Experimental Science, of which he had been a member since 1771. Some of the notes were more concerned with Franklin’s own affairs than with his friend, but all were intended to pave the way for him; we therefore print them together.

Having this Opportunity by my excellent Friend Dr. Priestly, (with whose Character as a Philosopher you must be acquainted) I send to the Society another Trifle of mine; of which I beg their Acceptance.
If the Society have published any of their Transactions, I should be glad to have them, and will readily pay the Charge. I am very respectfully Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant
