[November, 1770]
This is just to let you know I am well, but so busy that I cannot now write more than to acknowledge the Receipt of your kind Letter of Oct. 14. with Sally’s and Mr. Bache’s, which I shall answer per next Opportunity. Thanks for the Cranberrys. I am as ever Your affectionate Husband
B Franklin
