Sir
[February 11–12? 1765]
I send you enclos’d the Paper you desire. You will judge of the Propriety of Publishing it as it is, or what Alterations should be made in it. If there were any Liklihood of its being adopted, I could rather wish it were presented to the Ministry, provided their present Scheme of a Stamp Act might be laid aside.
