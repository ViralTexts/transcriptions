Sir
Passy April 29 1779
As you do my little Piece on the Aurora Borealis the Honor to suppose it may be agreeable to your philosophical Readers, I have requested M. Le Roi who read it at the Academy & has it in his Hands, to furnish you with a Correct Copy of it, which he has promised to do. With great Esteem I am &c
M. L’Abbé Rozier.
