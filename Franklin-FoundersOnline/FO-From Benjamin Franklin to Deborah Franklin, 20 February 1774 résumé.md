My dear Child,
[London, February 20, 1774]
I have written fully to you and several friends by Capt. All; but as I know you like to have a letter by every ship, I add this line by Capt. Falconer. … <Continues in good health and spirits, God be praised, and hopes to arrive at home next May. Sends affectionate regards and love to the children.>
