Sir
Passy, June 30. 1781

This is to request that you will accept no more Bills with an Expectation of my Paying them, till you have farther Advice from me: For I find that Mr. Laurens, who went away without informing me what he had done, has made so full a Disposition of the Six Millions granted at my Request before his Arrival, that unless the Specie he sent to Holland is stopt there, I shall not be in a Condition to pay them. I have the Honour to be, Sir, Your Excellencyâ€™s most obedient and most humble Servant

B Franklin
