These two notes for borrowers from the Library Company demarcated the sheep from the goats. The sheep, who were the members, promised to pay for books not returned on time and in good condition; the goats put down a refundable deposit. The requirement of a promissory note from a member went back at least to 1732, and a note to accompany a nonmember’s deposit was in use by 1763; but the printed forms themselves have not survived. The earliest promissory note extant in the Company is dated 1780; another, undated and signed by Franklin, is among his papers in the American Philosophical Society. The two differ slightly in wording, and both refer to the Company instead of leaving a blank, as in these texts, for the Librarian’s name. The forms that Franklin here seems to be copying, doubtless in answer to some query, were dated for use in the 1770’s; and he would have been unlikely to have had them with him, or to have received an inquiry about them, during his years in England or later in France. Hence our guess is that he copied them during his months in Philadelphia.
