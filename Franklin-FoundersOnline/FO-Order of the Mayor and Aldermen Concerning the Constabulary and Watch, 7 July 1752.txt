About 1735, according to his autobiography, Franklin read a paper to the Junto on the inadequacies of the Philadelphia city watch and proposed a tax-supported permanent watch. Though his scheme was approved by the Junto and its sister clubs, nothing came of it. The conditions Franklin criticized continued to worsen; and in 1743 the Grand Jury presented the watch as ill-organized, poorly managed, and expensive, its charges “Unequal and Grevious to the poorer part of the Citizens”; and asked for a “Stated Watch” paid out of taxes. The Philadelphia Council petitioned the Assembly for a law authorizing the changes, but the Assembly took no action. In 1749, reacting to increasing complaints of the citizens, the Grand Jury again presented the “Weakness and Insufficiency” of the watch, and in January 1750 the Council petitioned the Assembly again (Franklin serving on the committee to draft the memorial). A bill was introduced empowering the Philadelphia authorities to light their streets, specify the duties of constables and watchmen, and levy the necessary taxes. The Assembly moved slowly; Governor Hamilton objected to the bill as first passed; and not until February 9, 1751, was it enacted into law. Under this law the mayor, recorder, and aldermen (among whom Franklin was now one) drew up regulations for the town constables and watchmen.
 
[July 7, 1752]
