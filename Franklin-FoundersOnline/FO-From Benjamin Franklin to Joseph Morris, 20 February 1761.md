              Dear Friend
              London Feby: 20th. 1761
            
            I received your’s of Oct: 21 and Nov: 11 relating to the Library Affairs, which I have endeavoured to comply with by engaging a very honest and diligent Book-seller to provide and send the Books ordered by the Directors. Enclosed is the Invoice and Bill of Lading. I hope they will come safe to Hand and give Satisfaction. He has by my Direction added some late Books not in your List, but which I imagine the Company would like to have. My best Respects to the Directors my old Friends, whom I long once more to see. I have acquainted Mr. Collinson with the Mistake of the £30. Bill and shall settle the Company’s Account with him as you desire. I believe he has put some Books into the Box which he had bought for the Company before your letter to me came to hand.
            
              B: Franklin
