Sir,
Passy Dec. 17. 1778
It being extreamly improper for me who am a Stranger here, to trouble the Ministers with Solicitations for Persons unknown to me & in Affairs the Nature of which I am ignorant of, I must beg you to excuse my not doing what you desire of me. I return your Papers, as they may be of use to you, & am, Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant
