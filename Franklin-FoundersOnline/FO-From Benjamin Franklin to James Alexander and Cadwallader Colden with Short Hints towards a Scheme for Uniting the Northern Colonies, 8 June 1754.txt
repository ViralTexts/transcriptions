The Pennsylvania commissioners to the Albany Congress left Philadelphia on Monday morning, June 3, and arrived at New York on the afternoon of Wednesday, the 5th. Some of them, especially Richard Peters, were active during the next three days buying various goods for the Pennsylvania present to the Indians, apparently without Franklin’s assistance. On one of these days he and Peters met with their mutual friend James Alexander and the conversation turned “to the uniting the Colonies and the difficulties thereof,” as Alexander put it in a letter to Cadwallader Colden, June 9. Franklin thought he had a plan that might avoid some of those difficulties and promised “to set down some hints of a Scheme” for his friend. The result was the paper he sent, with a short covering note, to Alexander, June 8, the day before he left New York for Albany.
Franklin had believed in the need for some form of colonial union since at least 1751, when he had written James Parker describing a plan he thought might be effective. During the years that had elapsed the increasing menace of French encroachments could only strengthen his conviction, though he might develop or modify his ideas on the precise form a union should take and how it could best be put into operation. At some time between March 20, 1751, and June 8, 1754, he may have set down on paper the outline of a revised scheme, but there is no evidence that he did so. More probably his plan remained a matter of thought and possibly of conversation with friends until his talk with Alexander while on the journey to Albany, which resulted in the drafting of the paper printed below.
Precise comparison between the proposal of 1751 and that now sent to Alexander is impossible because the earlier version is couched in rather general terms and does not spell out the powers to be assigned to the new central agencies, though it does cover in broad language the same areas of Indian affairs and common defense. On most points which can be compared the two plans show no significant differences. The one striking exception is that Franklin believed in 1751 that the union should be a voluntary one, “entered into by the Colonies themselves,” while in 1754 he had become convinced that the plan, when perfected at Albany, should be “sent home, and an Act of Parliament obtain’d for establishing it.” Franklin was political realist enough to recognize, after his experiences with the Pennsylvania Assembly during that winter and spring on the matter of aiding Virginia against the French in the upper Ohio Valley, and after observing the narrow provincialism of the assemblies of some of the other colonies, that only the interposition of the mother country by act of Parliament could bring about such a union as he had in mind.
