Sepr. 26th. 1782
By letters from the Commissioners formerly, if you have them in your office it may appear to you that the Farmers general, soon after our arrival here, advancd us a million upon a contract for furnishing them with 5000 hhd. [hogshead] of tobacco which were to have been deliverd by Christmas 1778. Only three cargoes, on that account have been receivd by them. I have settled with them & given my acknowlegmt. of the debt due to them.
