Passy, 9th. July 1782.
From the Knowledge I have of Mr Young, by his Conduct while in my Family, writing in the Secretary’s Office, and waiting the Arrival of Mr. Lawrens then expected here; I esteem him a Person of Virtue and Merit, and I recommend him and his Account to the Consideration of Congress, not thinking myself authorised to discharge it without their Order; tho’ to assist him in his present Occasions, and in returning to America, I have ventured to advance him Three thousand Six hundred Livres.
B Franklin
