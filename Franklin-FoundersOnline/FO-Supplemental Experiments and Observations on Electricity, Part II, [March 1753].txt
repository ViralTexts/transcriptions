Franklin continued to send Peter Collinson reports of his electrical experiments through 1750–52, and Collinson gave them to Edward Cave to publish. On March 7, 1753, Collinson apologized for the printer’s slowness (see above, p. 455), but the pamphlet finally appeared later that month. It sold for sixpence and contained only twenty-four pages—a title page with verso blank and twenty-two pages of text numbered consecutively with those of the Experiments and Observations   of 1751. The contents, which have appeared in the present volume under their proper dates, are recapitulated here:
