B Franklin
Per Pacquet I shall write to the Speaker, Mr. Galloway and Mr. Hughes.


P.S. April 11. I have now time to answer the rest of your Letters. I received no Gammons by Bolitho, and suppose they are to come by Cuzzins. All that I had before are gone; they were much admired: I have still a Piece of one of the Pieces of Beef from which we now and then get a Bit. I never receiv’d any Cranberry’s from Boston.
I think the old Present of Buckskins or best Buckskin Gloves would be acceptable to your Birmingham Friends. I wish you had sent some of them. I forwarded your Letter but have not since heard from them.
  My Love to Cousin Spofford: I forwarded her Letter in to the Country when I first came to England, but have forgot how or where it was directed.
  I received your Letter by Mr. North. I should have ask’d him to dine here with Capt. Bolitho, but found there was some Difference between them.
  I lament the Death of our Friend Mifflin! by all outward Appearances, one might have expected a long Life for a Man of his Constitution and Temperance, but there is no Dependance on Appearances.

I have receiv’d the State of Mr. Smith’s Account. There are some Mistakes in it, which I shall endeavour to get rectify’d when I see Mr. [remainder missing].
