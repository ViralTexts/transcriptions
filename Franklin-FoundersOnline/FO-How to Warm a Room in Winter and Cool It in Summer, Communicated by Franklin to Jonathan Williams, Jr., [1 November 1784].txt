				Note the Back of the Kitchen Chimney being of Iron will warm the Room behind it, the folding doors being open allows the heat to pass into the Room & the air Pipe being shut prevents its going away: this is for Winter.— In summer the Doors being shut the heat cannot get into the Room & the slides being drawn out the heat will escape throw the air pipe. The hole at the bottom of the Doors feeds the pipe with air which rarifies & passes off. The Wooden Pipe supplies the Room with as much cool air fresh from the bottom of the Cellar.—
				This Idea was given me by Dr. B. F. at Passy 1. Novemb 1784. Jw
