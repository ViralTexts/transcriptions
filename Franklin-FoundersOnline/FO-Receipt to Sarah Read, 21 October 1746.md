Among Franklin’s papers in the American Philosophical Society is a receipt book of his mother-in-law, containing 27 receipts between 1715 and 1760, most of them between 1733 and 1747. Payments are recorded to William Rakestraw for carpentry, to Samuel Alford for making a silver spoon, to Anthony Nicholas “for Iron work Done too pump & Seller Dores of house,” to Bridget Sullivan for beef and veal, to Simon Edgell, Samuel Coates and others for various kinds of goods. Richard Warder signed two receipts for rent paid by Mrs. Read, Christopher Thompson signed one. There are receipts from three different Receivers General for quitrents paid the Proprietaries “on half a lot in high Street.” The only one given by Franklin is printed below. Mrs. Read’s signed receipt to her son-in-law on this settling of accounts is in his Ledger D.
