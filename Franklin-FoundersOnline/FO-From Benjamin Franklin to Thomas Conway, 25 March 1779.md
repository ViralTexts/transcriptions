Sir
Passy, March 25. 1779
I received the Letter you were so kind as to bring me from our Friend M. Peters. I congratulate you on your safe Return to your amiable Family. It would have given me great Pleasure, if the Service in America had been made so agreeable to you as to induce you and yours to settle there. With much Esteem I am, Sir &c.
Genl. Conway.
