---

Near the end of his life, probably after his return from France, to judge by handwriting, Franklin began to prepare a record of his service in the Pennsylvania Assembly. He compiled it simply by turning the pages of the printed Votes and Proceedings and noting his various assignments. In the process he overlooked a few; these have been inserted between brackets. In addition the manuscript is mutilated, but missing words and lines can be supplied by reference to the official record, and have accordingly been inserted between brackets. From January 11, 1763, through April 2, 1763, where the surviving manuscript breaks off, the entries are in William Temple Franklin’s hand. There must, however, have been several more pages in the original, carrying the record of Franklin’s service through 1764. This missing record has been supplied by the editors from the Votes and Proceedings of the Assembly.
Because Franklin’s record can serve as a brief introduction and résumé of his legislative service between 1751 and 1764, it is printed here, rather than under a presumed date of composition (1785–90). Many of the documents Franklin helped to draft are printed under their respective dates in this and succeeding volumes; the fact is indicated in each case. Citations are made to the Statutes at Large of Pennsylvania for bills which Franklin helped draft that became laws.
