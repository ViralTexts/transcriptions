Sir
[after October 15, 1778]
I received the Copies of the Charter, and the Tickets which you so obligingly sent me, in behalf of the Royal Society. I am extreamly sensible of the great Honour they have done me, in placing me at the Head of their foreign Members; and I shall not fail to attend their Meeting of the 20th Instant, which they so kindly invite me to.
