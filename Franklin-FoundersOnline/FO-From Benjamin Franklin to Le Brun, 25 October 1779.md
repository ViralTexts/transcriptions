Capt. Conyngham was sent to England in Irons to be try’d for his Life as a Pirate. The Congress ordered some English Prisoners of equal Rank to be put in Irons by way of Reprisal to abide his fate. Since his arrival in England, his Irons have been taken off and he is treated as the other Prisoners, and will probably Soon be exhang’d. Here are a Number of frenchmen that had serv’d with him and being put on Board one of his Prizes afterwards carried into England, were kept Prisoners there till Lately when we exhang’d them.

With great Regard, I have the honour to be &c

M. Le Brun
