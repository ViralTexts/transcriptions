This essay was first printed by Smyth (Writings, 11, 198), who considered it a “highly characteristic production.” The present editors, however, believe that the essay is not sufficiently characteristic of Franklin’s style to be attributed to him. No external evidence of authorship has been found and it is therefore omitted here.
