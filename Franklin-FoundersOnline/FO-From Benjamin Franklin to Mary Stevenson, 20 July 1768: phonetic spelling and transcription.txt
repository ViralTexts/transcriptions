Many writers, from the monk Orm in the early thirteenth century to George Bernard Shaw in the early twentieth, have experimented with methods of phonetic spelling. It was perhaps natural that Franklin, with his long exposure to the printed word and his varied and practical interests, should have been drawn into this company, and only surprising that he was in his sixties before he began his experimentation. The letter to Polly Stevenson that follows is his earliest known use of his new alphabet, and contains his clearest explanation of why he felt the need for one. Because the letter itself is anything but clear, at least at first glance, it is accompanied by a transcription.
At the same time Franklin sent Polly, as he mentions, some papers and a copy of his alphabet. The papers, not printed here, are all in the new orthography: quotations from the Creed, the Lord’s Prayer, Addison’s Campaign, etc., and a word list that might have been the first small step in composing a dictionary. An alphabet that is presumably the one he enclosed, and his explanations and comments upon it, follow the letter.

Dear Polly,
Richmond, July 20.—68
I intended to have sent you these Papers sooner, but being busy forgot it.
Mr. Coleman has mended daily; but your good Mother has been  indispos’d with a slight Fever, attended with much feebleness and weariness. She would not allow me to send you word of it at the time and is now better.
I wish you to consider this Alphabet, and give me Instances of such English Words and Sounds as you may think can not perfectly be expressed by it. I am persuaded it may be completed by your help. The greater difficulty will be to bring it into use. However, if Amendments are never attempted and things continue to grow worse and worse they must come to be in a wretched Condition at last; such indeed I think our Alphabet and Writing already in; but if we go on as we have done a few Centuries longer, our words will gradually cease to express Sounds, they will only stand for things, as the written words do in the Chinese Language, which I suspect might originally have been a literal Writing like that of Europe, but through the Changes in Pronunciation brought on by the Course of Ages and through the obstinate Adherence of that People to old Customs, and among others to their old manner of Writing, the original Sounds of Letters and Words are lost, and no longer considered. I am, my dear Friend, Yours affectionately,
B Franklin.
