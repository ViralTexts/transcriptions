On March 23, 1776, in response to petitions from merchants, Congress passed a set of resolutions to authorize privateering. The move was an answer to the Prohibitory Act of the previous December, which declared the colonies in rebellion and provided for confiscation of their shipping. That act was prominent among the grievances in the preamble that was actually adopted, as it is in this one. During the debate on the resolutions Franklin gave his opinion that they ought to be preceded by a declaration of war, and the tone of this draft is certainly bellicose. William Temple Franklin referred to the preamble as “not passed,” which may imply that it was offered and turned down. Or Franklin may have withheld it because he concluded that the language was stronger than the Congressional market would bear.
