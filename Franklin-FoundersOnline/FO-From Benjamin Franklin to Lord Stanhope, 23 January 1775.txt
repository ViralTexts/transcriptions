Cravenstreet, Jan. 23. 75.
Dr. Franklin presents his best Respects to Lord Stanhope, with many Thanks to his Lordship and Lord Chatham for the Communication of so authentic a Copy of the Motion. Dr. F. is fillâ€™d with Admiration of that truly great Man. He has seen in the Course of Life, sometimes Eloquence without Wisdom, and often Wisdom without Eloquence; in the present Instance he sees both united, and both as he thinks, in the highest Degree possible.
