Dear Sir,
Passy, March 13. 1779
I hope you got well to Nantes with your Son. We sent you two Letters by yesterday’s Post, that had been deliver’d here for you since your Departure; the enclos’d came last Night. By Captain Landais’ Letters, I am afraid he will not be ready so soon as we were made to expect.— I have the honour [torn: to] be, Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant
B Franklin
Honble Mr Adams
