          Sir,
            Passy, Dec. 10. 1783.
          I received the Letter you did me the honour of writing to me the 5th. Instant by Commo. Jones, with the Dispatches he brought. The Packet directed to me alone, containâ€™d only a Letter to the Magistrates of Hambourg, and a Diploma of Doctor of Divinity from the College at Princetown for the Reverend Mr Wren: No Commission, nor any Mention of it; so that it seems to have been forgotten or dropt. Perhaps our Letter which went with the Definitive Treaty may remind the Congress of it.
          I received the Letter you mention from Messrs Willink & Compa. I immediately consulted Mr Grand, who brought me a Sketch of his Account with Mr Morris, by which it appeared that it was not in our Power to give Relief. I hope your Presence in Holland may be of Service
          With great Respect I have the honour to be / Sir / Your most obedient humble Servant
          B Franklin
