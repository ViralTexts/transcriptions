Dear Sister,
London, March 23. 1774
A violent Cold which affects my Head and Eyesight, makes it inconvenient to me to write much; yet I would not miss the Opportunity of giving you this Line just to let you know that I am otherwise as usual. I hope you and yours are well, and am ever Your affectionate Brother
B Franklin
