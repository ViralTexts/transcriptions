Sir
July 4. 49
I sent word today to N. Holland, that you desired to see him, and offer’d him my Horse. He sent me word, he could get a Horse in the Neighbourhood, and would wait on you.
I return you Smith’s Travels with Thanks. I send you also Wr. Pope’s Life of Ward Bishop of Salisbury. I am, Sir, with great Respect Your most humble Servant
B Franklin
