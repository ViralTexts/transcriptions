Sir,
Passy, Dec. 15. 1781
I did myself the honour of writing to you about two Months since. I have not heard whether that Letter was receivâ€™d; and being told that a Packet Boat was lost about that time, I fear it miscarried, and therefore send a Copy. With great Respect, I am, Sir, Your most obedient and most humble Servant,
B. Franklin
Edmd. Burke Esqr
 
Endorsed: Dr. Franklin.
