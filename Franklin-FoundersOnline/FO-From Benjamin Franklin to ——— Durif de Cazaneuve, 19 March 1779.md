Sir
Passy March 19 1779
It wou’d be a Pleasure to me if I could comply with your Request, and every other of the same Nature; But the great Excess of Demands upon me for Advances of Money, above the Supplies I receive obliges me to refuse all that are not of absolute Necessity. As M. Adams is now at Nantes, who probably is acquainted with you, I imagine he has been good enough to furnish you. I am, Sir, y. m. o. h. S.

M. Cazenauve
