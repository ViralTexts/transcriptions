Sir,
London, Feb. 14. 1774
The Bearer, William Brown, being bred to the Tanning Business, is desirous of trying his Fortune in America. He is well recommended to me as a sober honest and diligent young Man. If it may not be inconvenient to you to afford him Employment as a Journeyman, I shall consider it as a Favour to me.
The Soles you were so kind as to send me have now been in Wear two Years, in common with others of this Country the best I could get, being in double Channel Pumps of half a Guinea a Pair; and yours appear to excel them in Firmness and Duration. I showâ€™d them the other Day to Capt. Falconer, who can tell you that they are still very good. With much Esteem, I am, Sir, Your obliged Friend and humble Servant
B Franklin
