The Philadelphia Lottery Papers in the Yale University Library contain many orders by the Managers to their treasurer William Allen to pay for gun carriages and repairs or for personal services and expenses. Franklin was not one of the managers of either lottery; he was, however, a member of a committee which joined them in spending the money (see above, p. 222). Documents illustrating this participation are grouped together here rather than in their respective chronological places.

      Mr. Kent serv’d at the last Lottery as one of the Clerks, for which he has not yet receiv’d any thing. He is just going to N. England. It is scarce worth while to call the Managers together on this Occasion. We suppose they will not disapprove of his being allow’d the same Pay as he had for his Service in the first Lottery, especially as the latter requir’d more Days Attendance.
