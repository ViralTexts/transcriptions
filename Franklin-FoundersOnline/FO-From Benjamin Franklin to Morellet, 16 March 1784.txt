Passy March 16. 1784

Your Sentiments and mine, my dear Friend, are exactly the same respecting the Imprudence of showing that Paper; it has therefore, thoâ€™ written some Months past, never been communicated to any one but your self, and will probably not appear till after my Decease, if it does then. You see how much I confide in your Friendship and Discretion.

The Translation appears to me in general good, and in some places better than the Original; in a few only it seems not fully to render the true Sense. When I next have the Pleasure of seeing you; we will read it together, and you will easily correct those Faults if they are such.
Yours most affectionately
