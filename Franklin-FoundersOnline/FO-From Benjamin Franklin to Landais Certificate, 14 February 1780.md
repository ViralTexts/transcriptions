Passy, feb. 14. 1780.
I do hereby certify whom it may concern, that the stay of Capt. Landais till this Time in Paris, has been occasioned partly on account of the enquiry into his Conduct in the late Cruise and partly as there has been no good Opportunity to My knowledge for his going sooner to america.
B.F
CopyCertificate given to Capt. Landais.
