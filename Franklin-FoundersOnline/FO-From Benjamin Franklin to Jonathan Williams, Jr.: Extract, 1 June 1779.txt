Passy June 1. 1779.
I think it will be best for you to pay what Ballance you suppose in your hands towards the Anchors, and draw on me for the Rest. This will answer the present purpose of satisfying M. Gourlade, and Errors if any may be rectified in the final settlement of your accounts.
Part of a Letter to Jonathan Williams
