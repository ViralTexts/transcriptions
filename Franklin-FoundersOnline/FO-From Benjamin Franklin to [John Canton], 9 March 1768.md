Dear Sir,
March 9. 68
Dr. Priestly left these Specimens of the Circles with me to be produc’d to the Society. As I cannot be there this Evening, when I understand the Paper is to be read,  I inclose them to you. Those that look at them should be caution’d not to rub them, lest they should be defac’d before the Company have all had a Sight of them. I am, Yours &c.
B Franklin
