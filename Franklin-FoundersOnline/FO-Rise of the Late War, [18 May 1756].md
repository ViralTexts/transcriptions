When and for what purpose Franklin prepared this brief chronology has not been determined; no direct connection between it and any of his other writings has been found. The words “late War” in the endorsement suggest 1763 or a subsequent year for its composition, although he may have added the endorsement some time after compiling the text. While he could not have known about the declaration of war, May 18, 1756, until two months later, the editors have decided to depart from their general chronological rules and print the chronology at this point, to mark an event of major importance in the history of colonial America and in Franklin’s own career.
