Passy, April 29. 1784—

Mr Franklin presents his respectful Compliments to Mr Jay, and sends a rough Draft of a Letter to Mr Adams, which he prays Mr Jay to correct to his Mind, and then permit the Bearer to copy it fair in his House, that it may receive his Signature, as Mr F. must send it away early to-morrow morning.
He requests to know how the Family does, fearing there may

be some Indisposition, as Company was not receiv’d yesterday Evening
