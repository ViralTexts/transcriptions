Sir,
Passy April 16. 1781
I received your Favour of the 21st February; It was a great Satisfaction to me to be informâ€™d that you had taken care to have my Grandson out of the Way of any Danger that might have arisen from your public Troubles, and I pray you to accept my Thanks. I hope those Troubles are now all over, and that you are happy in the general Tranquility, being with great Esteem, Sir,
M de Marignac
