				“Resolved, That Doctor Franklin be instructed to express to the Court of France the constant Desire of Congress to meet their Wishes; That these States are about to form a general System of Commerce by Treaties with other Nations: That at this

Time they cannot foresee what Claim might be given to those Nations by the explanatory Propositions from the Count de Vergennes on the 2d. & 3d. Articles of our Treaty of Amity & Commerce with His most Christian Majesty; but that he may be assured it will be our constant Care to place no People on more advantageous Ground than the Subjects of his Majesty.”
