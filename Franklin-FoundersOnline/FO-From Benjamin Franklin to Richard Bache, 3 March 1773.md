Dear Son
London, Mar. 3. 73
I received yours of Jan. 4. per Packet but none from Mrs. Franklin, whom you mention as writing at the same time. I lament the Death of my old good Friend Mr. Hall, but am glad to understand he has left a Son fit to carry on the Business, which wish he may do with as good a Character and as good Success as his Father.
The Gentleman who reported that Story of the House struck in Jamaica which had Conductors on it, has since sent me a Letter he received from thence, acquainting him, that before the Stroke the Conductors had been taken down in order to make some Repairs to the House; and the Knowledge that Conductors had been there, occasioned the Report among the People that a House with Conductors had been struck. And he now every where contradicts the Story. I shall be glad to know what Information you receive.
The Ohio Grant has not yet got the Seals affixed. â€™Tis good not to expect with any degree of Certainty, what is still subject to Accidents. My Love to Sally and Ben. I am ever Your affectionate Father
B Franklin
Your Mother and Sisters were well about a Month since.Mr Bache
