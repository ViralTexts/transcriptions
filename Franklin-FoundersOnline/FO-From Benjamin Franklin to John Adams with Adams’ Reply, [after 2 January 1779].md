Sir,
[after January 2, 1779]
Please to send me Mr Williams’s Letter that objects to the Clothing furnish’d by Mr Monthieu.
Also all the Papers you have relating to his Accounts—

In John Adams’ hand: Dr Franklin must be so good as to send somebody to search for these Papers— Mr Adams has no more the Custody of them than Dr Franklin and never will have.
