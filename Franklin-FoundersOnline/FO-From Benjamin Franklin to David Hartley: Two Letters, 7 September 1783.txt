          I.
          
            My dear Friend,
            Passy Septr. 7th. 1783
          
          The enclosed Letters to you and to Mr. Fox were written before I saw you yesterday. On my
            return home last night I found despatches from Congress which may remove the
            Difficulties we were entangled with. Mr. Adams will be here this Morning, when you
            will hear from us.
          I am ever Yours sincerely
          
            (signed)B. Franklin
            To David Hartley Esqr.
          
         
          II.
          
            My Dear Friend
            Passy Septr. 7. 83.
          
          Enclosed I send you an Extract of a Letter to me from the President of Congress in which you will observe the moderate
            disposition of that Body towards the Loyalists with the Causes of Aggravation in the
            Peopleâ€™s Resentments against them: I am always invariably Yours most sincerely
          
            (signed)B. Franklin
            David Hartley Esqr.
