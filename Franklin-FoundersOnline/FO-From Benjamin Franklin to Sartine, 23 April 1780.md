Sir,
Passy April 23d. 1780
I thank your Excellency for expediting the Orders relative to the Sale of the Serapis. I suppose similar Orders are gone to Dunkerque for the Sale of the Countess of Scarborough. If not I beg you would be pleased to send them by the Bearer; as the Daily heavy Charge that must arise on a Delay of Dispatching the Alliance, makes me anxious to see the Affair finished.
I am ever with the greatest Respect Your Excellencyâ€™s most obedient & most humble Servant
B Franklin
His Exy M. De Sartine.
