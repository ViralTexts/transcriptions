Dear Friend,
London, April 6. 1773
It is some time since I have had the Pleasure of hearing from you. I hope your Health is thoroughly established. Mr. Small often speaks of you with great Regard: I am glad to see by the News Papers that our Society have chosen him a Member. No Man more deserves it.
Our Silk will be sold next Thursday. The Broker was with me yesterday and tells me he thinks it improvâ€™d in the Winding Part, and that some of it is equal to almost any brought to Market here. He has sorted it into 4 Parcels, according to his Opinion of its Difference in Perfection. I inclose his Advertisement, and as soon as I can get it shall send his Account of Sales.
Mr. Robert Hare, who does me the favor of carrying this Letter, is a young Gentleman of excellent Character among all that know him here. He visits America with Views of establishing either at Philada. or New York, a Porter Brewery, being a thorough Master of that Business. I take the Liberty of recommending him to your Civilities, and request you would favour him with such Information and Advice as you may judge useful to him. With great Esteem, I am ever, my Dear Friend, Yours most affectionately
B Franklin
