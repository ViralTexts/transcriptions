He is strongly recommended to me by his Excellency the Ambassador from that Court; and I take leave to recommend him not only to the Civilities you are pleased in bestowing on Strangers of Merit but to all the Assistances and Facilities your Station and the Influence attending it may enable you to afford him in the Execution of his Commission, being persuaded that your Zeal for the Increase of useful Science, as well as the Respect due to his August Employer, will induce you to render Mr. Märter such Services with Pleasure. I have the honour to be, very respectfully, Sir, Your Excellency’s most obedient & most humble Servant
