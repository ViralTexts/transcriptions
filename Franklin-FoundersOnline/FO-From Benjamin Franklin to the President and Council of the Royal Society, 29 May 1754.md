Gentlemen,
Philada. May 29. 1754
The very great Honour you have done me, in adjudging me your Medal for 1753, demands my grateful Acknowledgements, which I beg you would accept as the only Return at present in my Power.
I know not whether any of your learned Body have attainâ€™d the ancient boasted Art of multiplying Gold; but you have certainly found the Art of making it infinitely more valuable.
You may easily bestow your Favours on Persons of more Merit; but on none who can have a higher Sense of the Honour, or a more perfect Respect for your Society and Esteem of its excellent Institution, than Gentlemen, Your most obliged and most obedient Servant
B Franklin
President and Council of the Royal Society.
