Dear Friend,
London, Augt. 22. 1772
I rejoiced to hear of your safe Arrival and happy Meeting with your Friends. I hope every other Circumstance there will prove agreable [to?] you, if you chuse to continue at Philadelphia.

Mrs. Stevenson, Mr. and Mrs. Hewson, Miss Dolly Blunt and Sally, continue to respect and Love y[ou as] does no less Your affectionate Friend and [Servant]
