Dear Sir,
Passy, Dec. 15. 1781
It being long since I have had the Pleasure of hearing from you, & understanding that a Packet Boat has been lost; I fear some of my late Letters may have miscarried, and therefore send the above Copies. With great Regard, I am, Dear Sir, Your most obedient and most humble Servant
B Franklin
