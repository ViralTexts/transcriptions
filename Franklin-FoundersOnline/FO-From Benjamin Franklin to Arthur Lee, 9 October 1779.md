SirPassy, Oct. 9. 1779.
I have received no Answer relative to the Proposition you mention. Perhaps without waiting longer for an Answer, throâ€™ Versailles it might be as well for you to apply directly to the Spanish ambassador for the Information you desire. With much Respect I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedt. humble servant
BF
Honble. Arthur Lee Esq.
