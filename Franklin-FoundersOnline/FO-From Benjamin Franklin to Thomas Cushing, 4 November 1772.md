Sir,
London, Nov. 4. 1772
Lord Dartmouth our new American Minister came to Town last Week, and held his first Levee on Wednesday, when I paid my Respects, acquainting him at the same time that I should in a few Days wait upon him on Business from Boston, which I have accordingly since done and have put your Petition to the King into his Hands, that being the regular Course. His Lordship receivâ€™d me very obligingly, and made no Objection to my acting as Agent without an Appointment assented to by the Governor, as his Predecessor had done; so that I hope Business is getting into better Train. I shall use my best Endeavours in supporting the Petition, and write to you again and more fully by the next Ship to Boston. In the mean time I remain with great Respect, Sir, Your most obedient and most humble Servant
B Franklin
Mr Cushing
