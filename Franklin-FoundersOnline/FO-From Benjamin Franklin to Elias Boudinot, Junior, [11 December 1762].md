[December 11, 1762]
I thank you for your kind congratulations on my return to my family and country. It gives me great pleasure to hear that you are married and well-settled and your brother and sister also. … I hope your good father’s indisposition will be of no long continuance. …
[B. Franklin]
[Mr. Boudenot]
