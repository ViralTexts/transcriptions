Franklin was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on April 29, 1756, and was formally admitted on Nov. 24, 1757. He attended meetings regularly, was a frequent guest at dinners of the Royal Society Club, and took an active part in the Society’s business, being elected a member of the Council in 1760, 1766, 1767, 1772. Between 1759 and 1774 he joined in recommending at least thirty-seven persons for election as fellows, in some instances, like that of John Winthrop of Harvard, probably initiating the action, in others supporting nominations first made by friends. Several of these candidates had made contributions to electrical science or other subjects in which he was interested, and many have appeared or will appear often in the pages of this edition.
The first recommendation Franklin signed was for Edward Hussey Delaval of Cambridge University, who was proposed on May 17, 1759, and elected the following December 6. The text of his certificate is printed in full below. Other certificates that Franklin signed nearly always followed the same general form, although they often mentioned the candidates’ particular fields more specifically. They will not be individually printed in this edition at their respective dates, but they are listed here in chronological order, showing their dates of nomination, not of election. All these nominating papers are in the archives of the Royal Society. Those in Franklin’s hand, or in which his name leads the list of nominators, are marked with an asterisk (*); probably they relate to people in whom he was especially interested. So far as possible the dates of birth and death of the candidates and brief indications of residence and special activities and interests are supplied.
