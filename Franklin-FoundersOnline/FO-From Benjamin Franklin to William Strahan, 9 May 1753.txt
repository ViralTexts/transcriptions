Dear Sir
Philad. May 9. 1753
I have your Favour of Jany. 30 and thank you for the Civility shown on my Recommendation to Mr. Harris. What you mention concerning the Books, was not at all amiss.
Neither the 2d Vol. of Bower’s History of the Popes, nor Delaresse’s Art of Painting, nor Crito, are to be found in Mr. Hall’s Trunks.
I have settled a Nephew of mine in Antigua, in the Place of Mr. Smith, deceas’d. I take him to be a very honest industrious Lad, and hope he will do well there, and in time be of some Use to you as a Correspondent. Please to send him a little Cargo of Books and Stationary, agreable to the Invoice over Leaf. I will send you a Bill on this Account perhaps by next Ship.
Please to tender my Compliments to Mrs. Strahan and Master Billy. I am, Dear Sir, Your obliged and most humble Servant
B Franklin
