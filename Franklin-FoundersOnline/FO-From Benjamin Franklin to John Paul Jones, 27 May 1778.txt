Dear Sir,
Passy, May 27. 1778
I received yours of the 18th. inclosing one for the Countess of Selkirk which I forward this Day via Holland as you desire. It is a gallant Letter, and must give her Ladyship a high and just Opinion of your Generosity and Nobleness of Mind.
The Dirty Insinuation you mention is of a Piece with many others from the same Quarter; the natural Produce of base Minds, who feeling no other Motive in their own Breasts, but sordid self-Interest, imagine no other Motive can exist in others, and therefore it is to that alone they ascribe the most praiseworthy Actions.
The Jersey Privateers do us a great deal of Mischief, by intercepting our Supplies. It has been mentionâ€™d to me, that your small Vessel, commanded by so brave an Officer, might render great Service by following them where greater Ships dare not venture their Bottoms; or being accompanied and supported by some Frigates from Brest, at a proper Distance, might draw them out, and then take them. I wish you to consider of this, as it comes from high Authority; and that you would immediately let me know what you think of it, and when your Ship will be ready.
I have written to England about the Exchange of your Prisoners.
I congratulate you most cordially on your late Success, and wish for a continuance and Increase of the Honour you have acquired. It will always be a Pleasure to me to contribute what may lay in my Power towards your Advancement and that of the brave Officers and Men under your Command. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant
B Franklin
Honble Capt. Jones
