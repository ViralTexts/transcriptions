            Our River has been fast some time, And we hear from Lewes, that ’tis all Ice towards the Sea as far as Eye can reach. Tuesday and Wednesday last are thought to have been the coldest Days we have had these many Years. [January 8]
          
          
            Great Quantities of English Half-pence being Imported here, since the falling of our Exchange, to be pass’d as Pennies, some considerable Dealers were apprehensive we should be overstock’d with them, and began last Week to refuse them otherwise than at the Rate of five for four pence. Their Example being follow’d by many of the Shopkeepers, while others continued to take them for pence apiece, it occasion’d Considerable Confusion in small Dealings. And the Bakers refusing to make any more Bread ’till the Money was settled, the Mob rose on Friday Night and went round the Town breaking the Windows of several Merchants and others, and very much disturbed the City. They began to assemble again the Night following; but by the Vigilance and Resolution of some of the Magistrates, they were timely surpress’d, and the City has since remain’d quiet. [January 8]

            We hear from Lancaster County, that during the Continuance of the great Snow which in general was more than three Foot deep, great Numbers of the back Inhabitants suffer’d much for want of Bread; that many Families of New-Settlers for some time had little else to subsist them but the Carcases of Deer they found dead or dying in the Swamps or Runns about their Houses; and although they had given all their Grain to their Cattle, many Horses and Cows are dead, and the greatest Part of the Gangs in the Woods are dead; that the Deers which could not struggle through the Snow to the Springs are believed to be all dead, and many of those which did get into the Savannahs are also dead, ten, twelve and fifteen being found in the Compass of a few Acres of Land. The Indians fear the Winter has been so fatal to the Deer, Turkeys, &c. in these Northern Parts, that they will be scarce for many Years. We also hear that a young Woman in Derry Township, attempting to get Home (about a Mile) as soon as she came within sight of her Father’s House turned out the Horse which she had borrow’d of her Neighbour, as he directed her; but not being able to make Way through the Snow, she threw off her Cloaths, and attempted to return on the Horses Footing; but after much struggling, as appear’d by her Tracts, she froze to Death.

            On Sunday last died the Reverend Mr. Archibald Cummings, Commissary of the Province of Pensylvania, and the Counties of New-Castle, Kent, and Sussex on Delaware, and Minister of Christ-Church in Philadelphia. He was a zealous Assertor of the Principles of the Christian Religion, a Sincere Professor of the Doctrine of the Church of England, a faithful Pastor in his Congregation, an able and instructive Preacher, and an eminent Example of Piety and Goodness through every Step of his Life and Conversation. In short, He was a Person so Universally esteem’d in this Place for his many good Qualities, but especially for his Charity and Moderation towards all Religious Societies of differing Pursuasions, that his Death is much lamented by all Sorts of People.

            On the 4th Instant, died Andrew Hamilton, Esq; and was the next Day inter’d at Bush-Hill, his Country Seat. His Corps was attended to the Grave by a great Number of his Friends, deeply affected with their own, but more with their Country’s Loss. He lived not without Enemies: For, as he was himself open and honest, he took pains to unmask the Hypocrite, and boldly censured the Knave, without regard to Station and Profession. Such, therefore, may exult at his Death. He steadily maintained the Cause of Liberty; and the Laws made, during the time he was Speaker of the Assembly, which was many Years, will be a lasting Monument of his Affection to the People, and of his Concern for the welfare of this Province. He was no Friend to Power, as he had observed an ill use had been frequently made of it in the Colonies; and therefore was seldom upon good Terms with Governors. This Prejudice, however, did not always determine his Conduct towards them; for where he saw they meant well, he was for supporting them honourably, and was indefatigable in endeavouring to remove the Prejudices of others. He was long at the Top of his Profession here, and had he been as griping as he was knowing and active, he might have left a much greater Fortune to his Family than he has done: But he spent more Time in hearing and reconciling Differences in Private, to the Loss of his  Fees, than he did in pleading Causes at the Bar. He was just, where he sat as a Judge; and tho’ he was stern and severe in his Manner, he was compassionate in his Nature, and very slow to punish. He was the Poor Man’s Friend, and was never known to with-hold his Purse or Service from the Indigent or Oppressed. He was a tender Husband and a fond Parent: But—these are Virtues which Fools and Knaves have sometimes in common with the Wise and the Honest. His free Manner of treating Religious Subjects, gave Offence to many, who, if a Man may judge by their Actions, were not themselves much in earnest. He feared God, loved Mercy, and did Justice: If he could not subscribe to the Creed of any particular Church, it was not for want of considering them All; for he had read much on Religious Subjects. He went through a tedious Sickness with uncommon Chearfulness, Constancy and Courage. Nothing of affected Bravery or Ostentation appeared; But such a Composure and Tranquility of Mind, as results from the Reflection of a Life spent agreeable to the best of a Man’s Judgment. He preserved his Understanding and his Regard for his Friends to the last Moment. What was given as a Rule for a Poet, upon another Occasion, may be justly apply’d to Him upon this,
