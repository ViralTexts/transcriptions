Dear SonPassy Dec 26 1782
You will hear of the progress made towards a Peace from various quarters. It is not yet concluded, and perhaps it may be some time first. But as soon as it is, I hope to be permitted to return home, there being nothing that I more desire, than to spend my last days with my family & lay my bones to rest in America.
