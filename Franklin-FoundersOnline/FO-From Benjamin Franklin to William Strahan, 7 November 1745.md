Sir
New York, Nov. 7. 1745
Finding a Vessel here about to sail to London, I take the Opportunity to enclose you a second Bill, the first of which I sent via Maryland. I left Mr. Hall and all Friends well at Philada last Week, and hope to see them again in a few Days. I have not Time to add but that I am Sir Your very humble Servant
B Franklin
