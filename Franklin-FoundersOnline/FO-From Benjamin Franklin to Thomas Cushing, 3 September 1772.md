Sir,
London, Sept. 3. 1772
I write this Line just to acknowledge the Receipt of your several Favours of July 15 and 16, enclosing the Resolves of the House relating to the Governorâ€™s Salary, and the Petition to the King. Lord Dartmouth, now our American Minister, will probably not be in Town till the Season of Business comes on, I shall then immediately put the Petition into his Hands, to be presented to his Majesty. I may be mistaken, but I imagine we shall not meet the same Difficulty in transacting Business with him as with his Predecessor, on whose Removal I congratulate you most heartily. I shall write fully per some of the next Boston Ships. At present can only add, that with the sincerest Esteem and Respect, I am, Sir, &c.
Honble. Thos Cushing, Esqr
