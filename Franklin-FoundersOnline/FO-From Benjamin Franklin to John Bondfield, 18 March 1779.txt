Sir
Passy Mar. 18 1779
I received your favours of the 6 & 9 inst. & thank you for the Intelligence they Contain. I hope generals Clinton & Thomson will give a good Acct. of the Invaders of Georgia. But if they should remain there till the end of the summer, a general fever at least will do a great Deal towards demolishing them. With much Esteem I am &ca
M. Bondfield.
