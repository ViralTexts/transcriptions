Dear Sir,

The Bearer Capt. Balm is strongly recommended to me, as a very able Officer of Horse, and capable of being extreamly useful to us, in forming a Body of Men for that Service. As he has otherwise an excellent Character, I take the Liberty of recommending him to my Friends as a Stranger, of Merit, worthy of their Civilities, and to the Congress as an Officer who if employâ€™d may greatly serve a Cause which he has sincerely at heart. With great Respect I have the Honour to be Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant
