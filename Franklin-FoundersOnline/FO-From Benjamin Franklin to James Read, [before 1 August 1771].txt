[Before August 1, 1771]
The most friendly Advice I can give you, is, to begin paying the Debt immediately, thoâ€™ in ever so small Sums. This will show an honest Disposition, and may in time compleat the whole. If you would stand fair in the Opinion of your Friends, and cannot pay the Principal, pay at least the Interest as it arises.
