Philadelphia, May 10, 1748
As to the Battery, it goes on very well, a great Number of Hands being employ’d upon it, who work with the utmost Diligence. I suppose that in a few Days the Platform will be ready to receive the cannon and the carriages are all made, a particular committee is employ’d in providing cartridges, &c., and Jno. Pass has already cast a great number of large shot.
