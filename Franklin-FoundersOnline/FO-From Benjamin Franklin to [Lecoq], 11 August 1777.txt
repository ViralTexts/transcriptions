Sir
Passy, Aug. 11. 1777.
The Equipping of armed Vessels in the Ports of France to act under Commissions from the Congress of America against the English, being contrary to Treaties, and therefore disagreable to Government here, your Friend’s Request cannot possibly be comply’d with. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant
B Franklin
