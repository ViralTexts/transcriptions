Sir,
Passy Sept. 7. 1779
Inclosed is a Letter for Capt. Jones, which you are desired to deliver him yourself as soon as possible, after his Arrival.â€”It will be well to keep secret that you expect him there.
I hope you had a good Journey home. I am with great Esteem Sir, Your most obedient & most humble Servant.
B Franklin
M. Dumas.
