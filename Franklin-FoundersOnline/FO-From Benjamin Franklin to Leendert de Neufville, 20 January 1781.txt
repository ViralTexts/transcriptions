You mention Mr Digges’s being in a disagreable Situation; please to tell me what it was, for I have not been so well inform’d of particulars as you imagine; and let me know what became of Mr Temple.
Please to present my Respects to your Father. I have the honour to be Sir Your
Mr L. de Neufville Amsterdam
