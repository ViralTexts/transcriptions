Dear Sir:
Paris, Feb. 17, 1778.
I was much obligâ€™d by your News of Gen. Burgoyne. Accept in Return my Congratulations on the Conclusion of two Treaties with France, one of Amity and Commerce the other of Alliance: which are on the most equal Terms, leaving our Trade open, acknowledging our Independence, and guaranteeing it with all our Possessions. This will probably bring on a War, for which both Nations have been long preparing, and it is now daily expected. I have the honor to be Dear Sir Your most obedient humble Servant
B. Franklin.
Honorable J. Langdon, Esq.
