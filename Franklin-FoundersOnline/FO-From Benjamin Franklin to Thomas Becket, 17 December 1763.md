Sir
Philada. Dec. 17. 1763
I have received yours of Sept. 12. with the Pamphlets, as mentioned. I have before acknowledged yours of June 24, which came duly to hand with the Books &c. I approve of your continuing Les Arts et Metieres.
The Directors of the Library Company thought the Books you sent them rather higher charg’d than usual; they had therefore, before I came home, fallen on another Method of being supply’d; which on your Account gave me some Concern, as they are constant Buyers, and good Pay.
On the other Side is List of a few Books, which I request you to send me per next Ships. I was glad to learn by your last, that my Friend Mr. Strahan was in good Health, as I had no Line from him. I am Your humble Servant
B Franklin
