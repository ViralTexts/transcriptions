          The Share allotted by the Lords of the Treasury to Pensylvania and the Lower Counties, of the Parliamentary Grant for 1758, was £29,993. The Rule their Lordships follow’d in the Division of the £200,000 was, to proportion the Sums for each Colony according to the Number of effective Men each had in the Field. These Numbers they took from Gen. Abercromby’s Report. By that Report it appear’d that Pensylvania had 2446 and the Lower Counties 281 in all 2727 Men; for which the Allowance was £29,993, as above. This Sum divided by the same Rule between Pensylvania and the Lower Counties, was

          The above Share of Pensylvania after deducting the Commissions allow’d me by the Act, is lodg’d in the Bank. When the Trustees draw for it, the Drafts must be upon me; for the Bank, as I wrote you before, will have no Account with them.
