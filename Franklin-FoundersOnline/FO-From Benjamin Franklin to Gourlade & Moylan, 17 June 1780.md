Gentlemen
Passy, June 17. 1780.
I am much obliged by your favour of the 13th. Instant. I am persuaded that your Conjecture of the Adviser and Promoter of the Mutiny, is well founded. Measures are taken that I hope may be successful in suppressing it. With great Esteem, I have the honour to be. Gentlemen Your &c.

Mrs. Gourlade and Moylan.
