                        Sir,
                        Passy 10. May 1783
                    
                    Permit me to introduce to you the Bearer Mr Hogendorff, of an illustrious Family, and Lieutenant in the Dutch Guards. He is strongly recommended to me by Persons of Distinction, as a Gentleman of excellent Character: His principal Design in going to America
                        is to make himself acquainted with the Country, and its Inhabitants: I beg you will favour him with your best Advice & Counsels which as a Stranger he may stand in need of, and which you have a Pleasure in affording to Persons of Merit. With great Regard, I have the
                        Honour to be, Sir, Your Excellencyâ€™s, most obedient and most humble Servant.
                    
                        B. Franklin
