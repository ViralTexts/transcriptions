          Duane (Works, IV, 319–40) and, on his authority, though less certain, Sparks (Writings, ii, 285–311), printed this long historical essay with its examples drawn mainly from Roman and English history. It is signed “X.” No evidence, internal or external, persuades the present editors that Franklin wrote it.
