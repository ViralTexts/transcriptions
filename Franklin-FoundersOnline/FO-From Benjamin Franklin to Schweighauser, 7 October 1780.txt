Sir,
Passy, Oct. 7. 1780.
This is to request you would write to Messrs. DeSegray & Company to forward the Saltpetre by land to Lâ€™Orient, where M. Williams will be ready to receive it & ship it with other Goods in his Hands for America. By doing this immediately you will much oblige me. With great Esteem I have the Honour to be,
M. Schweighauser.
