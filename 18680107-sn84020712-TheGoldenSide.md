There is many a rest in the road of life,
{:.indent-1}If only we would stop to take it;
And many a tone from the better land,
{:.indent-1}If the querulous heart would make it!
To the sunny soul, that is full of hope,
{:.indent-1}And whose beautiful trust ne'er faileth,
The grass is green and the flowers bright,
{:.indent-1}Though the wintry storm prevaileth.

Better to hope though the clouds hang low,
{:.indent-1}And to keep the eye still lifted;
For the sweet blue sky will soon peep through,
{:.indent-1}When the ominous clouds are rifted!
There was never a night without a day,
{:.indent-1}Or an evening without a morning;
And the darkest hour, as the proverb goes,
{:.indent-1}Is the hour before the dawning.

There is many a gem in the path of life,
{:.indent-1}Which we pass in our idle pleasure,
That is richer far than the jeweled crown,
{:.indent-1}Or the miser's hoarded treasure;
It may be the love of a little child,
{:.indent-1}Or a mother's prayers to Heaven,
Or a beggar's grateful thanks
{:.indent-1}For a cup of water given.

Better to weave in the web of life
{:.indent-1}A bright and golden filling
And to do God's will with a ready heart,
{:.indent-1}And hands that are swift and willing,
Than to snap the delicate minute, threads
{:.indent-1}Of our curious lives asunder;
And then blame Heaven for the tangled ends,
{:.indent-1}And sit and grieve and wonder.
