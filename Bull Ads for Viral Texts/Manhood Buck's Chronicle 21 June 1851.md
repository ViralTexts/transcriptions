Reviews of the Work

“Manhood, by J.L. Curtis. —“We agree with the Author that, so far from works of this class being objectionable in the hands of youth, or difficulties being opposed every facility should be given to their circulation; and, to strengthen our opinion, we need but refer to the recent distressing events at our Military and Scholastic Academies at Carshalton and Woolrich.” —Naval and Military Gazette. —1st Feb., 1851.

“We feel no hesitation in saying, that there is no member of society by whim the book will not be found useful, whether such person hold the relation of a Parent, Preceptor, or Clergyman.” —Sun Evening Paper

See also a thrilling and harrowing chapter in “Rush, on Diseases of the Mind;” and, as llustrative of the Author’s text, Physicians testify that the practice of these delusive habits is a greater source of derangement than all others, and, as is also observed by the truly intelligent superintendent of the Insane Hospitals in Worcester and Hatford, is probably the chief cause of many patients being brought there, but also an unsuperable obstacle to their recovery. — Medical Review

“Curtis on Manhood. — Fortunate for a country would it be, did its youth put into practice the philanthropic and scientific maxims here laid down — one cause of matrimonial misery might then be banished from our land, and the race to enervate be succeeded by a renewal of the hardy, vigorous spirits of the olden time” — Chronicle
