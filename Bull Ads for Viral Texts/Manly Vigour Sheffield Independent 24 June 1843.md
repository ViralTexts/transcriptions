“The various forms of bodily and mental weakness, incapacity, suffering and disease, faithfully delineated in this cautiously written and practical work, are almost unknown, generally misunderstood, and treated upon principles correspondingly erroneous and superficial, by the present race of medical practitioners. Hence the necessity for the publication of a timely safeguard, a silent yet a friendly monitor, or, where debility has made threatening inroads, the means of escape and the certainty of restoration. The evil to which thus book adverts are extensive and identical in their secret and hidden origin, and there are none to whom, as Parents, Guardians, Heads of Families, and especially of public Schools, is confided the care of young people, who ought to remain for a moment devoid of that information and those salutary cautions this work is intended to convey. Not only are the most delicate forms of debility neglected by the family physician, but they require for their safe management the exclusive study pf a life entirely abstracted from the routine of general practice, and (as in other departments of the profession) attentively concentrated in the daily and long-continued observation requisite for their correct treatment.

"If we consider the topics touched upon either in a moral or social view, we find the interests and welfare of mankind seriously involved. The effects of licentious, indiscriminate and secret indulgence in certain practices, are described with accuracy and forces which display at once profound reflection and extensive practical experience." — The Planet.

"The best of all Friends is the Professional Friend: and in no shape can he be consulted with greater safety and secresy than in "Lucas on Manly Vigour." The initiation  into indulgence — its progress — its results in both sexes, are given with faithful, but alas! For human nature, with affecting truth. However the Authors have not exposed the evil without affording a remedy. It shows how "Manly Vigiur," temporarily impaired, and mental and physical emasculation, produced by uncontrolled indulgence of the passions, can be restored; how the sufferer who has pined ion anguish from the consequences of early indiscretion — afraid almost to encounter his fellow man, can regain the vigour of health and moral courage. The work is written in a concise  and perspicuous style, displaying how often fond parents are deceived by the outward physical appearance of their youthful offspring; how the attenuation of the frame, palpitation of the heart, derangement of the nervous system, cough, indigestion, and a train of symptoms indicative of consumption or general decay, are often ascribed to wrong causes; and instead of being the natural results of congenital debility or disease, are the consequences of an alluring and pernicious practice, alike destructive to the mind and body." — Bell's New Weekly Messenger.
