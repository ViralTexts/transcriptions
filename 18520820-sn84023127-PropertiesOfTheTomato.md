**The Properties of the Tomato.**

To many persons there is something unpleasant, not to say disgusting, in the flavor of this excellent fruit. It has, however, long been used for culinary purposes, in various countries of Europe, and has of late years been extensively cultivated, and become a general favorite in this country. Dr. Bennett, a professor of some celebrity, considers it an invaluable article of diet, and ascribes to it very important medicinal properties. He declares:—

1. That the Tomato is one of the most powerful deobstruents of the *Materia Medica*, and that in all those affections of the liver, and other organs where calomel is indicated, it is probably the most effective and least harmful remedial agent known in the profession.
2. That a chemical extract will be obtained from it, which will altogether supersede the use of calomel in the cure of diseases.
3. That he has successfully treated diarrh&oelig;a, with this article alone.
4. That when used as an article of diet, it is almost a sovereign remedy for dyspepsia and indigestion.
5. That persons arriving from the east or north, to the south or west, should be all means make use of it as an aliment, as it would, in that event, save them the danger of attendant upon those violent bilious attacks to which almost all unacclimated persons are liable.
6. That the citizens in ordinary should make use of it, either raw, cooked, or in the form of a catsup, with their daily food, as it is the most healthy article in the *materia alimentaria*. 

Professor Ratinesque of France says: "It is everywhere deemed a very healing vegetable, vegetable, and invaluable article of food." 

Dungleson says:—"It may be looked upon as one of the most wholesome and valuable esculents that belong to the vegetable kingdom."

Professor Dickens asserts that it may be considered more wholesome than any other acrid sauce. 

A writer in the Farmer's Register says: "It has been tried by several persons, with decided success. They were afflicted with a chronic cough, the primary cause of which, in one case, was supposed to be diseased liver—in another, diseased lungs. It mitigates, and sometimes effectually checks a fit of coughing.

The method most commonly adopted in preparing this fruit for daily use, is to cut them in slices, and serve with salt, pepper and vinegar, as you do cucumbers.

To stew them: remove them ripe from the vines, slice up, and put them in a pot over the stove or fire, without water. Stew them slowly, and when done, put in a small piece of good butter, and eat them as you do apple sauce.—Some add a little flour, bread finely crumbled, or a couple of crackers pulverized.

The Tomato is a fruit very easily raised. If the seed be sown in May, in good rich soil, of a warm nature, with a sufficiency of old, well-rotted manure, there will rarely be a danger of failure. When the vines begin to lean, they should be provided with a trellis, or tied to stakes fixed in the soil, to keep the fruit from being injured by coming in contact with the dirt.
