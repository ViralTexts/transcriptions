Still sits the school house by the road,
{:.indent-1}A ragged beggar sunning;
Around it still the sumachs grow,
{:.indent-1}And blackberry vines are running.

Within, the master's desk is seen,
{:.indent-1}Deep scarred by raps official;
The warping floor, the battered seats,
{:.indent-1}The jack-knife's cared initial;

The charcoal frescoes on its wall;
{:.indent-1}Its door's worn sill, betraying
The feet that, creeping slow to school
{:.indent-1}Went storming out to playing!

Long years ago a setting sun
{:.indent-1}Shone over it at setting;
Lit up its western window-panes,
{:.indent-1}And low caves' icy fretting.

It touched the tangled golden curls,
{:.indent-1}And brown eyes full of grieving,
Of one who still her steps delayed
{:.indent-1}When all the school were leaving.

For near her stood the little boy
{:.indent-1}Her childish favor singled,
His cap pulled low upon a face
{:.indent-1}Where pride and shame were mingled.

Pushing with restless feet the snow
{:.indent-1}To right and left he lingered:—
As restlessly her tiny hands
{:.indent-1}The blue-checked apron fingered.

He saw her lift her eyes; he felt
{:.indent-1}The soft hand's light caressing,
And heard the tremble of her voice,
{:.indent-1}As if a fault confessing.

"I'm sorry that I spelt the word;
{:.indent-1}I hate to go above you,
Because,"—the brown eyes lower fell,—
{:.indent-1}"Because, you see, I love you."

Still memory to a gray haired man
{:.indent-1}That sweet child-face is showing,
Dear girl! the grasses on her grave
{:.indent-1}Have forty years been growing!

He lives to learn, in life's hard school,
{:.indent-1}How few who pass above him
Lament their triumph and his loss,
{:.indent-1}Like her,—because they love him.
