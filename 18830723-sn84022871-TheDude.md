THE DUDE.

[As much has been said in the papers of late about the "Dude" I have procured, at great expense, (?) a correct picture of one, which I respectfully submit to the MONITOR readers for their inspection.]

A is the actress  
this dude so besets.  
B is his billiards, bill, bouquets,  
and bets. C is his  
cheek, cigarette, cane  
and collar. D is his drinks  
on another man's dollar.  
E is his eye glass and  
English airs. F is the  
free lunch that he  
never  
spares. 
G is the girl he en-  
deavors to mash. H is his hat  
just as flat as his cash. I is his  
ignorance, always displayed.  
J is the jewelry on his array-  
ed. K is his knowledge of folly  
and sin. L is his legs that  
are crooked and thin. M is  
his mustache, nine hairs  
to a side. N is is neck-tie, a  
soiled shirt to hide. O's his  
old man, whom he'll not indorse.  
P's his pocket-book, empty, of  
course. Q is his quarrel  
when he gets a kick.  
R is the racket that makes  
him so sick. S is his shoes  
very sharp  
at the toe. T  
is his tailor,  
who fills  
him with  
woe. U is  
his uncle,  
who pays  
ante's bill.  
V is his  
vice that  
makes him  
look so ill.  
W's his wash-  
woman scold-  
ing the beat.  
X is Xertion to keep  
on his feet. Y is his yawns, for  
he's tired out. Z's the Zigzag he walks  
when tight.
