My feet are wearied, and my hands are tired—
{:.indent-3}My soul oppressed—
And with desire have I long desired
{:.indent-3}Rest—only Rest.

'Tis hard to toil—when toil is almost vain
{:.indent-3}In barren ways;
'Tis hard to sow, and never garner grain
{:.indent-3}In harvest days.

The burden of my days is hard to bear—
{:.indent-3}But God knows best.
And I have prayed—but vain has been my prayer,
{:.indent-3}For Rest—sweet Rest.

'Tis hard to plant in spring, and never reap
{:.indent-3}The autumn yield;
'Tis hard to till—and when 'tis tilled to weep
{:.indent-3}O'er fruitless field.

And so I cry a weak and human cry,
{:.indent-3}So heart oppressed;
And so I sigh a weak and human sigh
{:.indent-3}For Rest—for Rest.

My way has wound across the desert years,
{:.indent-3}And cares infest
My path, and thro' the flowing of hot tears
{:.indent-3}I pine for Rest.

'Twas always so; when still a child, I laid
{:.indent-3}On mother's breast
My wearied little head; e'en then I prayed,
{:.indent-3}As now, for Rest

And I am restless still; 'twill soon be o'er;
{:.indent-3}For, down the West,
Life's sun is setting, and I see the shore
{:.indent-3}Where I shall Rest.
