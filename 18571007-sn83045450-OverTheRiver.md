Over the river they beckon to me—
{:.indent-1}Loved ones who've crossed to the further side;
The gleam of their snowy robes I see,
{:.indent-1}But their voices are drowned by the rushing tide.
There's one with ringlets of sunny gold,
{:.indent-1}And eyes the reflection of Heaven's own blue;
He crossed in the twilight, gray and cold,
{:.indent-1}And the pale mist hid him from mortal view.
We saw not the angels that met him there;
{:.indent-1}The gate of the city we could not see;—
Over the river, over the river,
{:.indent-1}My brother stands waiting to welcome me!

Over the river the boatman pale,
{:.indent-1}Carried another—the household pet;
Her brown curls waved in the gentle gale—
{:.indent-1}Darling Minnie! I see her yet!
She crossed on her bosom her dimpled hands,
{:.indent-1}And fearlessly entered the phantom bark;
We watched it glide from the silver sands,
{:.indent-1}And all our sunshine grew strangely dark.
We know she is safe on the further side,
{:.indent-1}Where all the ransomed and angels be;
Over the river, the mystic river,
{:.indent-1}My childhood's idol is waiting for me.

For none return from those quiet shores
{:.indent-1}Who cross with the boatman cold and pale;
We hear the dip of the golden oars,
{:.indent-1}And catch a gleam of the snowy sail,—
And lo! they have passed from our yearning hearts;
{:.indent-1}They cross the stream and are gone for aye:
We may not sunder the vail apart
{:.indent-1}That hides from our visions the gates of day.
We only know that their barks no more
{:.indent-1}May sail with us o'er life's stormy sea;
Yet somewhere, I know, on the unseen shore,
{:.indent-1}They watch, and beckon, and wait for me!

And I sit and think, when the sunset's gold
{:.indent-1}Is flushing river and hill and shore,
I shall one day stand by the water cold,
{:.indent-1}And list for the sound of the boatman's oar:
I shall watch for a gleam of the flapping sail;
{:.indent-1}I shall hear the boat as it gains the strand;
I shall pass from sight with the boatman pale,
{:.indent-1}To the better shore of the spirit land;
I shall know the loved who have gone before,
{:.indent-1}And joyfully sweet will the meeting be,
When over the river, the peaceful river,
{:.indent-1}The angel of Death shall carry me!
