**The Value of Lemons**

Somebody who appears to know all about it writes positively that it will draw the sting of the hot weather, not only for this time, but for months to come, to understand the right use of lemons. Most people know the benefit of a lemonade before breakfast, but few know how it is more than doubled by taking another at night also. The way to get the better of all bilious systems without blue pill or quinine, is to take juice of one, two or three lemons, as the appetite craves, in as much ice water as makes it pleasant to drink, without sugar, just before going to bed. In the morning on rising, or at least half an hour before breakfast, take the juice of one lemon in a goblet of water. This will clear the system of humors and bile with mild efficacy, without any of the weakening effects of calomel or Congress water. People should not irritate their stomachs by eating lemons clear; the powerful acid of the juice, which is almost corrosive, infallibly produces inflammation after awhile, but properly diluted, so it does not burn or draw the throat, it does its full medicinal work without harm, and taken when the stomach is clear of food has oppor­tunity to work on the system thor­oughly.
