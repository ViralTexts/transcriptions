A CANADIAN PHRASE.—Canada's bright and sensible <sic>governer-general</sic>, Lord Dufferin, has given the dominion people a new by-word, which has spread with electric rapidity from one end of Canada to the other. On his voyage out, being called upon by the emigrants to address them, he alludes to this phrase, which had grated harshly on his ears: "He had the misfortune to have too many children." Lord D. said: "I remarked that perhaps no better idea could be given of the differences between the old country and their new home than by the fact that whereas in England a struggling man might be overweighted in the battle of life by an numerous family, in the land to which they were going a man could scarcely have too many children. Here I was applauded lustily, with a cheerful accompaniment of laughter also, when I was further greeted with an approving thump on the back by a stalwart young emigrant, who cried out, 'Right you are, sir; that's what I've been telling Emily.'" The Canadians have got up the slang phrase, That's what I've been telling Emily," having had the anecdote made familiar by going the rounds of the papers, and one hears everywhere, "That's what I've been telling Emily."—*Ex*.
