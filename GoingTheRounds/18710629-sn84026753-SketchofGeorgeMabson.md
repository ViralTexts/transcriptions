Sketch of the Hon. Geo. L. Mabson, of North Carolina.

by George M. Arnold

The first colored man that has ever been permitted to be a lawyer in North Carolina, or admitted to practice in her State courts, is Hon. Geo. L. Mabson, of New Hanover county. Mr. Mabson graduated at Howard University in the class of 1871, and was examined and licensed by the Judges of the Supreme Court of North Carolina, at Raleigh, June 16, 1871, “to practice law in all the courts of the State.” The Judges of the Supreme Court of North Carolina are all Southern white men, of moderate Republican views, and it is well known that they tested Mabson well before they said yes. Many of his friends thought he could not pass as these judges would require him to do; but, acting like true and honorable men to their calling, they only demanded of Mr. Mabson what they did of white men–-proof of good moral character and sufficient knowledge of the law to justify their favorable action. All this Mr. Mabson had; and today the march of progress adds another star to her galaxy–a colored man of respectability and standing has a law office in the city “down by the sea!”

When the reconstruction acts took effect in this State, Gen. Joseph C. Abbott secured Mr. Mabson a position in Washington, with the understanding that he was to devote his leisure hours to the study of law; and now what a pleasure it must be to Gen. Abbott, who has been Mabson’s benefactor these four years, to walk by the court-house and read that sign: “George L. Mabson, Attorney and Counsellor at Law.”

In politics Mr. Mabson has been, and is now, the recognized leader of the colored people of the eastern part of the State. In the very heat of battle, beginning at 1867 down to the present moment, he has been a bold, daring, and chivalrous member of the advanced radical idea of reconstructing the insurgent States to their forfeited relationship with the Federal Government. While he is a bitter political for, still he has qualities that make him respected by his enemies. In manner he is dignified, and is recognized in this State as one of the colored men of a “high sense of honor;” is a member of the Baptist Church, and regarded as a man of strict morals and integrity.

Last August he was elected to the lower house of the General Assembly, and from the date he was sworn in till the close of the session he was the recognized leader of the colored members. His speech on the illegality of the convention bill was rated as first-class by the papers of both parties in the States.

In January last he was almost unanimously elected President of the State Labor Bureau of North Carolina. Since the death of the lamented Senator Golloway the colored people of this State have looked upon Mr. Mabson as their political leader.

One of the Democratic papers of Wilmington-–the Star-–noticing Mr. Mabson’s admission to the bar, says:

“The efforts of George L. Mabson, the colored member from this county, in the last Legislature, who has been making application for license to practice law, have at last been rewarded with success. He qualified before the Supreme Court now in session at Raleigh on the 17th inst.; his certificate, which was signed by Justices Pearson, Reade, Rodman, and Dick, authorizes him to practice law in all the courts of the State. Justice Boyden, being sick, was not present.

“Taking into consideration the fact that this is the first instance in which a colored man has been admitted to the bar of North Carolina, it may not be amiss to give a short sketch of the recipient of the honor. George Lawrence Mabson was born in Wilmington, N.C., and is 25 years of age. At the age of 8 years he left his native town and went to Boston, Massachusetts, where he attended school up to the time of the breaking out of the war. He then volunteered in the U.S. Navy and served two years, at the expiration of which time he enlisted in the 5th Massachusetts cavalry, in which he served until the close of the war. In 1866 he returned to North Carolina, and in 1868 began the study of law, graduating at Howard University, Washington, D. C., in the class of January 1871. In personal appearance he is what may be termed a light mulatto, being about five feet ten inches in height, slight built and of rather prepossessing appearance. In intelligence he can compare favorably with any of his race that have come under our observation.”

Mr. Mabson’s certificate of moral character (which the law requires be signed by three members of the bar) was signed by the Hon. A. M. Waddell, member of Congress from this district, Adam Emphil, Esq., and Griffith J. McRea, (the biographer of Judge Iredell,) all of whom are staunch Democrats; and since his success the entire bar of Wilmington, comprising thirty Democratic and three Republican lawyers, have extended him all the courtesies due from old to new members of the “legal profession.”

What a glorious achievement!

“From the auction-block to the ballot-box;

From the whipping-post to the school-house;

From Slavery’s degradation to Freedom’s responsibility;

From dark ignorance to Liberty’s shining light.”
