The following article we copy from an old manuscript for the benefit of our juvenile readers.

1\. Three little words we often see
{:.indent1}Are A<small>RTICLES</small>, *a*, *an*, and *the*.

2\. A N<small>OUN'S</small> the name of any thing,
{:.indent1}As *school* or *garden*, *hoop*, or *swing*.

3\. A<small>DJECTIVES</small> tell the kind of noun,
{:.indent1}As *great*, *small*, *pretty*, *white*, or *brown*.

4\. Instead of *Nouns* the P<small>RONOUNS</small> stand;
{:.indent1}John's head, *his* face, *my* arm, *your* hand.

5\. V<small>ERBS</small> tell of something being done;
{:.indent1}To *read*, *write*, *count*, *sing*, *jump*, or *run*.

6\. How things are done, the A<small>DVERBS</small> tell:
{:.indent1}As *slowly*, *quickly*, *ill*, or *well*.

7\. C<small>ONJUNCTIONS</small> join the words together;
{:.indent1}As men *and* children, wind *or* weather.

8\. A P<small>REPOSITION</small> stands before
{:.indent1}A noun; as *in* or *through* a door.

9\. The I<small>NTERJECTION</small> shows surprise;
{:.indent1}As *oh!* how pretty, *ah!* how wise.

The whole are called nine P<small>ARTS</small> *of Speech*,
Which *Reading*, *Writing*, *Speaking* teach.
