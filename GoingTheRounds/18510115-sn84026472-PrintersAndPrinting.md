**Printers and Printing**.—J. T. Buckingham, in his series of reminiscences, in course of publication in the Boston Courier, speaks of the importance of the printer to authors, as follows: 

"Many who condescend to illuminate the dark world with their fire of genius, through the columns of a newspaper, little think of the lot of the printer, who, almost suffocated by the smoke of a lamp, sits up till midnight to correct his false grammar, bad orthography, and wrose (sic) punctuation. I have seen the arguments of lawyers, in high repute as scholars, sent to the printer in their own hand writing, many words—and especially technical and foreign terms—abbreviated, words misspelled, and few or no points, and those few, if there are any, entirely out of place. I have seen the sermons of divines sent to the press without points or capitals to designate the division of sentences: sermons which, if published, would disgrace the printer's devil if he were the author. Suppose they had been so printed. The printer would have been treated with scorn and contempt, as an illiterate blockhead—as a fellow better fitted to be a woodsawyer than a printer. Nobody would have believed that such gross and palpable faults were owing to the ignorance and carelessness of the author. And no one but the practical printer knows how many hours the compositors, and after him the proof-reader, is compelled to spend, in reducing to a readable condition manuscripts that the writer himself would be puzzled to read.
