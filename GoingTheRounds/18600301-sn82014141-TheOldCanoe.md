**THE OLD CANOE.**

**BY EMILY R. PAGE.**

Where the rocks are gray, and the shore is steep,  
And the waters below look dark and deep;  
Where the rugged pine in its lonely pride,  
Leans gloomily over the murky tide;  
Where the reeds and rushes are tall and rank,  
And the weeds grow thick on the winding bank;  
Where the shadow is heavy the whole day thro',  
Lies at its mooring, the old canoe.

The useless paddles are idly dropped,  
Like a sea bird's wings that the storm hath lopped,  
And crossed on the railing one o'er one,  
Like folded hands when the work is done;  
While busily back and forth between,  
The spider stretches his silvery screen,  
And the solemn owl with his dull "too-hoo,"  
Settles down on the side of the old canoe.

The stern half sunk in the slimy wave,  
Rots slowly away, in its living grave;  
And the green moss creeps o'er its dull decay,  
Hiding the mouldering dust away,  
Like the hand that plants o'er the tomb a flower,  
Or the ivy that mantles the fallen tower;  
While many a blossom of loveliest hue  
Springs up o'er the stern of the old canoe.

The current waters are dead and still,  
But the light winds play with the boat at will;  
And lazily in and out again,  
It floats the length of the rusty chain,  
Like the weary march of the hands of time,  
That meet and part at the noontide chime;  
And the shore is kissed at each turn anew  
By the dipping bow of the old canoe.

Oh, many a time, with a careless hand,  
I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,  
And paddled it down where the stream runs quick,  
Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are thick,  
And laughed as I leaned o'er the rocking side,  
And looked below in the broken tide,  
To see that the faces and boats were two,  
That were mirrored back from the old canoe.

But now as I lean o'er the crumbling side,  
And look below in the sluggish tide,  
The face that I see there is graver grown,  
And the laugh that I hear has a sobered tone,  
And the hand that lent to the light skiff wings  
Have grown familiar with sterner things;  
But I love to think of the hours that flew,  
As I rocked where the whirls their white spray threw,  
Ere the blossoms waved, or the green moss grew,  
O'er the mouldering stern of the old canoe.
