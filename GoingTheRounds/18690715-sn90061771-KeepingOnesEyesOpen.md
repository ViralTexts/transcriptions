**Keeping One's Eyes Open.**

Nobody is more like an honest man than a thorough rogue. When you see a man with a great deal of religion displayed in his shop window, you may depend upon he keeps a very small stock of it within. Do not choose your friend by his looks: handsome shoes often pinch the feet. Don't be fond of compliments: remember, "Thank you, pussy, and thank you, pussy," killed the cat. Don't believe in the man who talks most; for mewing cats are very seldom good mousers. By no means put yourself in another person's power: if you put your thumb between two grinders, they are very apt to bite. Drink nothing without seeing it; sign nothing without reading it, and make sure that it is no more than it says. Don't go to law unless you have nothing to lose: lawyers houses are built on fools' heads. In any business, never wade into water where you cannot see the bottom. Put no dependence upon the label of a bag; and count money after your own kin. See the sack opened before you buy what is in it; for he who trades in the dark asks to be cheated. Keep clear of the man who does not value his own character. Beware of every one who swears; he who would blaspheme the Maker, would make no bones of lying or stealing. Beware of no man more than yourself; we carry our worst enemies within us. When a new opinion or doctrine comes before you, do not bite till you know whether it is bread or a stone; and do not be sure that the gingerbread is good because of the gilt on it. Never shout halloa! till you are quite out of the wood; and don't cry fried fish until they are caught in the net. There's always time enough to boast—wait a little longer. Don't throw away the dirty water till you have got clean; keep on at scraping the roads till you can get better work; for the poorest pay is better than none, and the humblest office is better than being out of imployment. Always give up the road to bulls and madmen; and never fight with a coal-heaver, or contend with a base character, for they will be sure to blacken you. 

Neither trust nor contend,  
Nor lay wagers, nor lend,  
And you may depend  
You'll have peace to your end,  
—Rev. C. H. Spurgeon.
