A Printer’s Epitaph
Here lies a *form*, place no *imposing stone*
To mark the *head*, where weary it is lain,
Tis *matter dead*, its mission being done,
To be *distributed* to dust again.
The body is but the *Type*, at best, of man,
Whose *impress* is the spirit’s deathless *page*;
Worn out, the *type* is thrown to *pi* again,
The *impression* lives through an eternal age.
