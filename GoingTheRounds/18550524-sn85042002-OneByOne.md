One by one the sands are flowing,
{:.indent-1}One by one the moments fall;
Some are coming, some are going,
{:.indent-1}Do not strive to grasp them all.

One by one thy duties wait thee,
{:.indent-1}Let the whole strength go to each,
Let not future dreams elate thee,
{:.indent-1}Learn thou first what these can teach.

One by one (bright gifts from Heaven,)
{:.indent-1}Joys are sent thee here below;
Take them readily when given,
{:.indent-1}Ready, too, to let them go.

One by one thy griefs shall meet thee,
{:.indent-1}Do not fear an armed band;
One will fade as others greet thee,
{:.indent-1}Shadows passing through the land.

Do not look at life's long sorrow;
{:.indent-1}See how small each movement's pain;
God will help thee for to-morrow:
{:.indent-1}Every day begin again.

Every hour that fleets so slowly,
{:.indent-1}Has its task to do or bear;
Luminous the crown, and holy,
{:.indent-1}If thou set each gem with care.

Do not linger with regretting,
{:.indent-1}Or for passion hours despond;
Nor, the daily toil forgetting,
{:.indent-1}Look too eagerly beyond.

Hours are golden links, God's token,
{:.indent-1}Reaching Heaven; but one by one,
Take them lest the chain be broken
{:.indent-1}Ere the pilgrimage be done.
