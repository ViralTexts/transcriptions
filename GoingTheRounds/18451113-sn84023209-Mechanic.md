THE MECHANIC.—A young man commenced visiting a young woman, and appeared to be well received. One evening he called at the house when it was quite late, which led the girl to inquire where he had been. "I had to work late to-night;" he replied. "Do you work for a living?" inquired the astonished girl. "Certainly," replied the young man, "I am a mechanic."—"My brother does'nt work," she remarked, "and I dislike the name of mechanic," and she turned her pretty nose.

That was the last time the mechanic visited the young woman. He is now a wealthy man, and has one of the best women for a wife.—The young woman who disliked the name of a mechanic is now the wife of a miserable tool, a regular vagrant about grog-shops; and she, poor and miserable girl, is obliged to take in washing in order to support herself and children.

Ye who dislike the name of mechanic—whose brothers do nothing but loaf and dress—beware how you treat young men who work for a living. Far better discard the well-fed pauper, with all his rings, jewelry, brazen facedness and pomposity, and take your affections to the callous-handed, intelligent and industrious mechanic. Thousands have bitterly regretted their follow, who have turned their backs on honest industry. A few years of bitter experience taught them a severe lesson. In this country, no man or woman who is in health, should be respected, in our way of thinking, who will not work bodily or mentally, and who curl their lips with scorn when introduced to our working men.
