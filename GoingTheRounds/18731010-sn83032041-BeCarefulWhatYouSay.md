In speaking of a person's faults
{:.indent-1}Pray don't forget your own;
Remember, those with homes of glass
{:.indent-1}Should seldom throw a stone;
If we have nothing else to do
{:.indent-1}But talk of those who sin,
'Tis better we commence at home,
And from *that* point begin.

We have no right to judge a man,
{:.indent-1}Until he's fairly tried;
Should we not like his company,
{:.indent-1}We know the world is wide;
Some may have faults—and who have not—
{:.indent-1}The old as well as young;
Perhaps we may, for aught we know,
{:.indent-1}Have fifty to their one.

I'll tell you of a better plan,
{:.indent-1}And find it works full well;
I try my own defects to cure
{:.indent-1}Before of others tell;
And though I sometimes hope to be
{:.indent-1}No worse than some I know,
My own shortcomings bid me let
{:.indent-1}The faults of others go.

Then let us all, when we commence
{:.indent-1}To slander friend or foe,
Think of the harm one word may do
{:.indent-1}To those who little know;
Remember, curses, sometimes like
{:.indent-1}Our chickens, "roost at home;"
Don't speak of others' faults until
{:.indent-1}We have none of our own.
