**What to Do in Case of Accident.**

Prof. Wilder, of Cornell University, gives these short rules for action in case of accident. It would not be a bad thing to cut them out and carry them in one's pocketbook, or, better yet, commit them to memory:

For dust in the eyes, avoid rubbing; dash water in them, remove cinders, etc, with the round point of a lead pencil. 

Remove insects from the ear by tepid water—never put a hard instrument into the ear.

If an artery is cut, compress above the wound; if a vein is cut, compress below. 

If choked, get upon all fours and cough.

For slight burns, dip the part in cold water, if the skin is destroyed cover with varnish.

Smother a fire with carpets, etc,; water will spread burning oil, and increase danger. Before passing through smoke, take a full breath and then stoop low; but if carbon is suspected, walk erect. 

Suck poisoned wounds, unless your mouth is sore; enlarge the wound, or, better, cut out the part without delay; hold the wounded part as long as can be borne to a hot coal or the end of a cigar.

In case of poisoning, excite vomiting by tickling the throat or by warm water and mustard.

For acid poisons, give alkalies, for alkaline poisons, give acids—white of egg is good in most cases; in case of opium poisoning, give strong coffee, and keep moving.

For apoplexy, raise the head and body; for fainting, lay the person flat.
