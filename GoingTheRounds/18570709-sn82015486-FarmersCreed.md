THE FARMER'S CREED.—One of our exchanges gives the following first rate advice, under the heading of "The Farmer's Creed:"

We believe in small farms and thorough cultivation. The soil loves to eat, as well as its owners, and ought therefore to be nurtured. We believe in large crops, which leave the land better than they found it, making both the farm and farmer rich at once. We believe in going to the bottom of things, and therefore in deep plowing, and enough of it—all the better if with a subsoil plow. We believe that the fertility of any soil is thee spirit of industry, enterprise, and intelligence—without this, lime and gypsum, bones and green manure, marl or plaster, will be of little use. We believe in a clean kitchen, a neat wife in it, a spinning piano, and clean cup-board, dairy, and conscience. We firmly disbelieve in farmers that will not improve; in farms that grown poor every year; in starved cattle; in farmers' boys turning into clerks and merchants; in farmers' daughters unwilling to work; and in all farmers who are ashamed of their vocation.
