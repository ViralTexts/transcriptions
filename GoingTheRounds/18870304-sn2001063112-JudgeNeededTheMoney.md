**The Judge Needed the Money**

I have just heard the following good story on Chief Justice Bleckley. All who know Judge Bleckley and recall his long waving hair and beard will appreciate the story. Judge Bleckley was on his way to the Supreme Court one morning when he was accosted by a little street gamin, with an exceedingly dirty face, with the customary "Shine, sir?"

He was quite importunate, and the Judge, being impressed with the oppressive untidiness of the boy's face, said: I don't want a shine, but if you will go wash your face I'll give you a dime."

"All right sir."

"Well, let me see you do it."

The boy went over to an artesian hydrant and made his ablution. Returning, he held out his hand for the dime.

The Judge said, "Well, sir, you've earned your money; here it is."

The boy said, "I don't want your money, old fellow; you take it an have your hair cut." Saying which he scampered off.â€”*Augusta (Ga.) Chronicle*.
