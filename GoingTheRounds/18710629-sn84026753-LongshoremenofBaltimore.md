The Longshoremen of Baltimore

[From the Baltimore American.]

The hall of the Douglass Institute was well filled last night by a class of laborers, chiefly colored, known as “Longshoremen.” The object of the meeting was to consider and adopt some line of action to ameliorate their condition, to ask for an increase of wages, the present wages being twenty cents per hour, the advance asked for being twenty-five cents.

The meeting was called to order by electing Mr. James Powell, President; Moses Johnson, Rostin Blackwell, and William B. Lambson, Vice-Presidents; B. Smith, Secretary.

Resolutions

Whereas the system practiced by a number of the stevedores in their regulations of work is both unjust and oppressive, and productive of much suffering in the support of our families, as well as an incentive to crime that is not only demoralizing to the honest workingmen, but often a serious loss to the exporter and importer; and whereas the pay for our labor is but twenty cents per hour, and the averge time made is but four hours per day the year round, giving us an average of eighty cents a day to support our families; therefore, be it

Resolved, That we petition the master stevedores, first, to abandon the practice of forcing men to do the “extra work” without pay–that is, hauling in and making vessels fast to the wharf, rigging purchases, cleaning up vessels after the cargo is taken out, &c.; second, not to allow any man to assist in unloading a vessel unless he is paid for his services; third, that they will adopt a more perfect system of keeping time, thereby avoiding the continual disputes, which is not only the cause of much unpleasantness, but a serious loss to the poor laborer; fourth, that they be requested to issue checks or certificates of time at the completion of each job; fifth, that they will advance our pay from twenty cents to twenty-five cents per hour.

Resolved, That for the better protection of our business, and for the interest of all parties concerned, that we form ourselves into an association to be called the Longshoremen’s Association No. 1 of Baltimore.

Resolved, That this organization be incorporated in the National Labor Union of the United States.

Remarks of Mr. Myers.

The resolutions were adopted unanimously, after which Mr. Isaac Myers, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Colored National Labor Union, was introduced and said: He accepted the invitation of the committee to address this meeting from a sense of duty. It could not be a pleasure to any Christian man to lift up the curtain and look into the actual condition of this class of laborers, with its fearful consequences to society in general. There is a good deal in relation to the management of this branch of business that it would be well to pass over in silence at present. Let the dead language of the resolutions speak. It is the handwriting upon the wall. The time has come for a revolution in the management of this business, and few there are who will oppose it. And indeed I cant’t see, from what I know, how any man can oppose it. You ask for the privilege of being honest. You ask for the privilege of being honest. You ask not to be crowded into circumstances that will be an inducement to crime. You ask that each man interested in the business may have that which is his, and you have all the time you work, and no more. You make the very reasonable request that your wages may average six dollars per week. More honorable and reasonable requests never emanated from any body of men.

I am glad that you agree with me that “strikes” are not only injurious, but a serious loss to the employer and employed, and indeed I may say in your branch of business utterly suicidal. Your cause is so just, and the class of men who you most rely upon—-the merchants of Baltimore-—so reasonable, that any grievance can be adjusted without leaving a trace of unpleasantness behind.

He hoped the sober-minded pulpit, press, and statesmen would investigate the causes that are producing these sudden demonstrations of the workingmen in this country. They are premonitions-—strong evidence of smothered volcanoes, in which may be encased all the worst passions of the human heart. That each demonstration has a justifiable cause there can be but little doubt. The danger is not in the organization of workmen, but in their being handled by unscrupulously ambitious men; the hallucinating argument that capital is the natural enemy of labor; the delusion that labor can only get its just rights and adjust its relationship to capital by running a political party, getting control of the Government, and by legislative enactments regulate the price of labor and the equalization of capital. To avoid the fearful consequences of this training of the working millions is the power of the pulpit, the press, and statesmen demanded.

The pulpit too frequently dances to the music of your damnation. Here is a man who contributes ten thousand dollars to the Young Men’s Christian Association and gives his thousands annually to the support of the Christian ministry. To the one hundred men he employs he gives one dollar a day or seven dollars a week to support a family of four or six persons. His princely donations should be given back to him and he advised to observe first the first principles of Christianity, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. “ Is it wise to disease the body for the sake of employing a physician? Would it not be better to prevent a crime than to punish it? Would it not be better to pay the laborer living wages than be taxed to support poor-houses, jails, penitentiaries, insane asylums, and other agencies for the reformation and punishment of criminals? More particularly, when we know that nine-tenths of the crimes committed, and three-fourths of the criminals in our prisons, are superinduced by this and kindred causes.

I hope in your organization you will inculcate temperance, and that the money you would spend for whiskey you will deposit in the savings bank. These rum mills are the gateways to hell, and we can never hope for a general improvement in the condition of the laboring man until he becomes more temperate. I hope the stevedore will abandon the practice of paying you off in a whiskey magazine. I hope they will not lead you into temptation and then send you to hell for being tempted. Be modest and cautious in all your deliberations.

Remarks of Mr. R. B. Sorrell.

Mr. R. B. Sorrell was next introduced and said, fifteen years ago the stevedores got three cents a barrel, now they get two to one and a half cents; then they paid the men one dollar and twenty five cents in gold, and according to the price of the necessaries of life at that time the laborer could get a decent living; now it was impossible for laborers to live at less than thirty cents an hour. The stevedores should go to the merchants and ask for an advance in the prices, so that they may be able to pay the men better wages. He believed the merchants would pay living wages.
