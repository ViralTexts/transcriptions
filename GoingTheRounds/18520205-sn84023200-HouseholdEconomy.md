HOUSEHOLD ECONOMY.â€”Would you have your children intelligent, and your household well regulated, let the Bible be read, and the morning and evening "thanksgiving, confession, supplication and praise" ascend to Him who has said "_train_ up a child in the way he should go, and _when he is old_ he will not depart from it." Would you have them excell [sic] the children of those who furnish no food for the mind, give them access to schools, and by no means neglect to furnish them with a well conducted country newspaper, whose editor is a lover of good reading and good morals. A school teacher, who has been engaged a long time in his profession, and has witnessed the influence of a newspaper upon the minds of a family of children, thus writes to the editor of the Ogdensburgh Sentinel:

"I have found it to be a universal fact, without exception, that those scholars of both sexes, and of all ages, who have had access to the newspapers at home, when compared with those who are not, are,

1st, Better readers, excelling in pronunciation and emphasis, and consequently read more understandingly.

2d, They are better spellers and define words with greater ease and accuracy.

3d, They obtain a practical knowledge of Geography in almost half the time it requires others, as the newspaper has made them familiar with the location of all the important places, nations, their governments and doings on the globe.

4th, They are better Grammarians, for, having become familiar with every variety of style, in the newspaper, from the common-place advertisement to the finished and classical oration of the statesman, they more readily comprehend the meaning of the text, and consequently analyze its construction with greater accuracy.

5th, They write better compositions, using better language, containing more thoughts, more clearly and connectedly expressed.

6th, Those young men who have for years been readers of half the newspapers, are always found taking the lead in the debating society, exhibiting a more extensive knowledge upon a greater variety of subjects, and expressing their views with greater fluency, clearness and correctness in the use of language. 

To the poor, the weekly newspaper is a precious boon. They cannot afford books, and, indeed, would have but little time to read them. But for the merest trifle, hardly to be missed, a whole family may draw almost daily from an inexhaustible fund of reading. The father can discuss the contents of his newspaper at the breakfast table, with his wife and children, and go forth to his labor supplied with materials for thought, which cannot fail to make him wiser and better, and elevate him in the scale of humanity."
