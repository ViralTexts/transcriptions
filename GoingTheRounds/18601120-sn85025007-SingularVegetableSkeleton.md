A SINGULAR VEGETABLE SKELETON.â€”A singular story is told of an apple tree planted over the grave of Roger Williams. This tree had pushed downward one of its main roots in a sloping direction, and nearly straight course, toward the precise spot that had been occupied by the skull of Roger Williams. There making a turn conforming with the circumference, the root followed the direction of the back-bone to the hips, and thence divided into two branches, each one following the leg bone to the heel, where they both turned upwards to the extremities of the toes of the skeleton. One of the roots formed a slight crook at the part occupied by the knee joint, thus producing an increased resemblance to the outlines of the skeleton of Roger Williams, as if, indeed, moulded thereto by the powers of vegetable life.
