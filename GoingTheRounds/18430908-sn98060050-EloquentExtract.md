*Eloquent Extract*.—"Generation after generation," says an eloquent writer, "have felt as we feel, and their fellows were as active in life as ours now. They passed away in a vapor, while nature wore the same aspect of beauty as when her Creator commanded her to be. And so likewise shall it be when we are gone. The heavens shall be as bright over our graves as they are now around our path; the world will have the same attraction for offspring yet unborn that she once had for ourselves, and that she has now for our children. Yet a little while and all this will have happened! The throbbing heart will be stilled and shall be at rest.—Our funeral will wind on its way, and the prayers will be said, and the grave clods will be thrown in, and our friends will all return, and we shall be left behind to darkness and the worm. And it may be for some short time that we shall be spoken of, but the things of life will creep in, and our names will soon be forgotten. Days will continue to move on, and laughter and song will be heard in the very chamber in which we died; and the eye that mourned for us will be dried and glisten again with joy; and even our children will cease to think of us, and will not remember to lisp our names. Then shall we have become in the touching language of the Psalmist, "forgotten and clean out of mind."
