**Delicacy in Conversation**

A maxim of Bruyere's is going the rounds of the English newspapers. It will do for Chicago:

There is speaking well, speaking easily, speaking justly, and speaking seasonably. It is offending against the last to speak of entertainments before the indigent; of sound limbs and health before the infirm; of houses and lands before one who has not so much as a dwelling; in a word, to speak of your prosperity before the miserable. This conversation is cruel, and the comparison which naturally arises in them betwixt their condition and yours is excruciating.
