USE AND ABUSE OF SCISSORS.

That simple piece of mechanism, a pair of scissors, is an invaluable aid to the editor when honestly and fairly used, says S. A. Davis in the _Journalist_. When used as a burglar's tool to break into the columns of a contemporary newspaper and steal valuable ideas and news, without giving proper credit, public sentiment justly anathematizes the editor who puts this valuable little tool to such base uses. It is often the case that the editorial burglar is proven a fraud and pretender in more ways than one. 

A good many people do not know that an editor's selections from his contemporaries is quite often the best test of his editorial ability, and that the function of the scissors are not merely to fill up vacant spaces, but to reproduce the brightest and best thoughts, and the most attractive news from all sources at the editor's command. Readers of a newspaper often wonder why the editor's pen is frequently superseded by the scissors on the editorial page, and the reasons are as varied and numerous as the fitful changes of human thought. Sometimes the editor's brain is clogged or worn by physical causes, and his power of expression fail him. Often the cares of life weigh heavily upon him, and he has no heart to write or labor. If in such cases the scissors are used as a substitute for mental labor, the general result is a stupid issue, which justifies the criticism of the reader. 

But there are times when the editor opens his exchanges, and finds a feast for the eyes, heart and soul. The thoughts of his contemporaries glow with life, and send the warmth into his own soul. He wishes his readers to enjoy the feast, and he lovingly takes up the scissors and clips, and sighs to think that his space is inadequate to contain all the treasures so prodigally spread before him. Your true editor is generous, and will sacrifice his own ambitions as a writer during such festal occasions. His conduct at such a time is now generous, and is of far more profit to his readers to set before them than the original dish of dainties, with the label of the real arthur <--! sic --> affixed, than to appropriate its best thoughts to himself and reproduce them as his own.

After all, the true test of a newspaper's real value is not the amount of original matter it contains, but the average quality of all the matter appearing in its columns whether original or selected.â€”_New York Monthly Union_.
