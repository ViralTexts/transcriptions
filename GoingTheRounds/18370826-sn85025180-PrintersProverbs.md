PRINTERS PROVERBS

1. Never enquire thou of the Editor for the news, for behold it is his duty at the appointed time to give it unto thee without asking.
2. When thou dost write for his paper, never say unto him "what thinkest thou of my piece," for it may be that the truth might offend thee.
3. It is not fit that thou should ask of him, who is the author of any article, for his duty requires him to keep such things unto himself.
4. When thou dost enter into a printing office, have a care unto thyself, thou dost not touch the type; for thou may'st cause the printer much trouble.
5. Look thou not at the copy which is in the hands of compositors; for that is not meet in the sight of the printer.
6. Neither examine thou the proof sheet for it is not ready to meet thine eye, that thou may'st understand it.
7. Prefer thy country (State!) paper to any other:—subscribe immediately for it, and pay in advance, and it shall be well with thee and thy little ones.—*Brownsville*.
