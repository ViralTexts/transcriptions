I live for those that love me,  
{:.indent-1}For those I know are true,
For the heaven that smiles above me,
{:.indent-1}And awaits my spirit too;
For all the human ties that bind me,
For the task by God assign'd me,
For the bright hopes left behind me,
{:.indent-1}And the Good that I can do.

I live to learn their story,
{:.indent-1}Who've suffered for my sake,
To emulate their glory,
{:.indent-1}And follow in their wake;
Bards martyrs, patriots, sages,
The noble of all ages,
Whose deeds crowd history's pages,
{:.indent-1}And time's great volume make.

I live to hail that season,
{:.indent-1}By gifted minds foretold,
When men shall live by reason,
{:.indent-1}And not alone by goldâ€”
When man to man united,
And every wrong thing righted,
The whole world shall be lighted,
{:.indent-1}As Eden of old.

I live to hold communion
{:.indent-1}With all that is divine,
To feel there is a union
{:.indent-1}'Twixt Nature's heart and mine;
To profit by affliction,
Reap truths from fields of fiction,
Grow wiser from conviction,
{:.indent-1}And fulfill each great design.

I live for those that love me,
{:.indent-1}For those who know me true,
For heaven that smiles above me,
{:.indent-1}And awaits my spirit too;
For the wrong that needs resistance,
For the cause that lacks assistance,
For the FUTURE in the distance,
{:.indent-1}And the good that I can do.
