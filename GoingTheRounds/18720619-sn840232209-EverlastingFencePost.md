EVERLASTING FENCE POSTS.—There is a peculiar satisfaction in listening to the conversation, or in reading the writings of positive men,—as those who deal only with facts, and with such facts as have but one side and no exceptions. Such a man tells us, in the _Western Rural_, how to preserve posts for fences &c. He says:—"I discovered many years ago that wood could be made to last longer than iron in the ground, but thought the process so simple and inexpensive that it was not worth while making any stir about it. I would as soon have poplar, basswood, or quaking ash as any other kind of timber for fence posts. I have taken out basswood after having been set seven years, that were as sound when taken up as when first set in the ground. Time and weather seemed to have no effect on them. The posts can be prepared for less than two cents apiece. 

For the benefit of others, I will give the recipe. Take boiled linseed oil, and stir in pulverized charcoal to the consistency of paint. Put a coat over the timber, and there is not a man that will live long enough to see it rotten.
