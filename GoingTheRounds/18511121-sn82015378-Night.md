The day is done, and the darkness
{:.indent-1}Falls from the wings of night,
As a feather is wafted downward
{:.indent-1}From an eagle in his flight.

I see the lights of the village
{:.indent-1}Gleam through the rain and the mist,
And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me,
{:.indent-1}That my soul cannot resistâ€”

A feeling of sadness and longing,
{:.indent-1}That is not akin to pain,
And resembles sorrow only
{:.indent-1}As the mist resembles the rain.

Come, read to me some poem,
{:.indent-1}Some noble and heartfelt lay,
That shall soothe this restless feeling,
{:.indent-1}And banish the thoughts of day.

Not from the bards sublime,
{:.indent-1}Not from the bards sublime,
Whose distant footsteps echo
{:.indent-1}Through the corridors of time.

For, like strains of material music,
{:.indent-1}Their mighty thoughts suggest
Life's endless toil and endeavor;
{:.indent-1}And to night I long for rest.

Read from some humble poet,
{:.indent-1}Whose songs gush from his heart
As showers from the clouds of summer,
{:.indent-1}Or tears from the eye-lids start.

Who through longs days of labor,
{:.indent-1}And nights devoid of ease,
Still heard in his soul the music
{:.indent-1}Of wonderful melodies.

Such songs have power to quiet
{:.indent-1}The restless pulse of care,
And come like the benediction
{:.indent-1}That follow after prayer.

Then read from the treasured volume
{:.indent-1}This poem of thy choice,
And lend to the rhyme of the poet
{:.indent-1}The beauty of thy voice.

And the night shall be filled with music
{:.indent-1}And the cares that infest the day
Shall fold up their tents like the Arabs,
{:.indent-1}And silently pass away.
