**The World is Agreeable.**

This is an agreeable world after all. If we would only bring ourselves to look at the objects that surround us in their true light, we should see beauty where we behold deformity, and listen to harmony where we heard nothing but discord. To be sure there is a great deal of vexation and anxiety to meet; we cannot sail up a summer coast for ever; yet, if we reserve a calm eye and steady hand, we can so trim our sail and manage our helm as to avoid quicksands and weather the storms that threaten shipwreck. We are members of one great family; we are travelling the same road, and should arrive at the same goal. We breathe the same air, are subject to the same bounty, and we shall lie down upon the bosom of our common mother. It is not becoming then that brother should hate brother—it is not proper that friend should deceive friend; it is not right that neighbor should injure neighbor. We pity that man who can harbor enmity against his fellow; be loses half the enjoyment of life—he embitters his own existence. Let us tear from our eyes the colored medium that invests every object with the green husk of jealousy and suspicion; turn a deaf ear to scandal; breathe the spirit of charily from our hearts—let the rich gushings of human kindness swell up as a fountain; so that the “golden age” will become no fiction, and the islands of the blessed, bloom in more than “Hyperion beauty.”
