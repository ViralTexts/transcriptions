{:.indent-3}Tell me, ye winged winds,
{:.indent-4}That rounds my pathway roar,
{:.indent-3}Do ye know some spot
{:.indent-4}Where mortals weep no more?
{:.indent-3}Some lone and pleasant dell,
{:.indent-4}Some valley in the west,
{:.indent-3}Where, free from toil and pain,
{:.indent-4}The weary soul may rest?
The loud wind dwindled to a whisper low,
And sighed for pity as it answered "No!"


{:.indent-3}Tell me, thou mighty deep,
{:.indent-4}Whose billows round me play,
{:.indent-3}Know'st thou some favored spot,
{:.indent-4}Some island far away,
{:.indent-3}Where weary man may find
{:.indent-4}The bliss for which he sighs,
{:.indent-3}Where sorrow never lives,
{:.indent-4}And friendship never dies?
The loud waves rolled in perpetual flow,
Stopped for a while, and sighed, to answer "No!"

{:.indent-3}And thou, serenest moon,
{:.indent-4}That with such holy face,
{:.indent-3}Dost look upon the earth
{:.indent-4}Asleep in night's embrace,
{:.indent-3}Tell me, in all thy round,
{:.indent-4}Has thou not seen some spot,
{:.indent-3}Where miserable man,
{:.indent-4}Might find a happier lot.
Behind a cloud the moon withdrew in wo,
And a voice sweet, but sad, responded "No!"

{:.indent-3}Tell me my secret soul,
{:.indent-4}Oh! tell me, Hope and Faith,
{:.indent-3}Is there no resting place
{:.indent-4}From sorrow sin and death;
{:.indent-3}Is there no happy spot
{:.indent-4}Where mortals may be bless'd,
{:.indent-3}Where grief may find a balm,
{:.indent-4}And weariness a rest?
Faith, Hope, and love, best boons to mortals given,
Wav'd their bright wings, and whispered, "Yes in Heaven."
