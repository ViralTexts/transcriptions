She is modest, but not bashful,
{:.indent-1}Free and easy, but not bold,
Like an apple, ripe and mellow,
{:.indent-1}Not too young and not too old;
Half inviting half repulsive,
{:.indent-1}Now advancing, and now shy;
There is mischief in her dimple,
{:.indent-1}There is danger in her eye.

She has studied human nature;  
{:.indent-1}She is schooled in all its arts;
She has taken her diploma,
{:.indent-1}As the mistress of all hearts.
She can tell the very moment
{:.indent-1}When to sigh and when to smile;
O, a maid is sometimes charming,
{:.indent-1}But a window, all the while!

Are you sad? how very serious
{:.indent-1}Will her handsome face become;
Are you angry? she is wretched,
{:.indent-1}Lonely, friendless, tearful, dumb;
Are you mirthful? how her laughter,
{:.indent-1}Silver-sounding, will ring out,
She can lure, and catch, and play you
{:.indent-1}As the angler does the trout.

Ye old bachelors of forty,
{:.indent-1}Who have grown so bold and wise;
Young Americans of twenty,
{:.indent-1}With the love-locks in your eyes;
You may practise all the lessons
{:.indent-1}Taught by Cupid since the fall,
But I know a little widow,
Who could win and fool you all!

JACKSON, Miss., May 1st, 1857.
