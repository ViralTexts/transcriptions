**A Romish Nut**

A Roman Catholic priest, some time since in Germany, entering the pulpit, took a walnut into it. He told the people that the shell was tasteless and valueless --- that was Calvin's Church. The skin was nauseous, disagreeable, and worthless --- that was the Lutheran Church. He then said he would show them the Holy Roman Apostolic Church. He cracked the nut and found it _rotten_!
