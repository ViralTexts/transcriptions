'Tis well to woo, 'tis well to wed,
{:.indent-1}For so the world has done
Since myrtles grew, and roses blew,
{:.indent-1}And morning brought the sun.

But have a care, ye young and fairâ€”
{:.indent-1}Be sure ye pledge with truth,
Be certain that your love will wear
{:.indent-1}Beyond the days of youth.

For, if ye give not heart for heart,
{:.indent-1}As well as hand for hand,
You'll find you've played the unwise part
{:.indent-1}And "built upon the sand."

'Tis well to save, 'tis well to have
{:.indent-1}A goodly store of gold,
And hold enough of the shining stuff,
{:.indent-1}For charity is cold.

But place not all your hopes and trust
{:.indent-1}In what the deep mine brings;
We cannot live on yellow dust
{:.indent-1}Unmixed with purer things.

And he who piles up wealth alone,
{:.indent-1}Will often have to stand
Beside his coffer chest, and own
{:.indent-1}'Tis "built upon the sand."

'Tis good to speak in kindly guise,
{:.indent-1}And soothe where'er we can;
Fair speech should bind the human mind
{:.indent-1}And love link man to man.

But stay not at the gentle words,
{:.indent-1}Let deeds with language dwell,
The one who pities starving birds,
{:.indent-1}Should scatter crumbs as well.

The mercy that is warm and true
{:.indent-1}Must lend a helping hand,
For those who talk, yet fail to do,
{:.indent-1}But "build upon the sand."
