**Medical Uses of Salt**

In many cases of disordered stomach, a teaspoonful of salt taken three times a day is a certain cure. In the violent internal aching, termed cholic, add a tablespoonful of salt a pint of cold water, drink it and go to bed; it is one of the speediest remedies known.—The same will revive a person who seems almost dead from a heavy fall, &c. In an apoplectic fit not time should be lost in pouring salt and water down the throat, if sufficient sensibility remain to allow swallowing; if not, the head must be sponged with cold water until the senses return, when salt and water will completely restore the patient from the lethargy. In the fit the feet should be placed in warm water, with mustard added, and the legs briskly rubbed, all bandages removed from the neck, &c. and a cool apartment procured if possible. In many cases of severe bleeding at the lungs, when other remedies fail, Dr. Rush found two teaspoonfuls of salt completely stayed the flow of blood.—In cases of bite from a mad dog, wash the part with strong brine for an hour, then bind on some salt with a rag. In toothache, warm salt and water held to the part and renewed two or three times will relieve in most cases. If the gums be affected, wash the mouth with brine; if the teeth be covered with tartar, wash them twice a day with salt and water.—In swelled neck wash the part with brine, and drink it also, twice a day until cured.—Salt will expel worms if used in the food in moderate degree, and aids digestion, but salt meet is injurious if much used. 

It is reasonable to suppose that what is most plentiful on earth, is most essential to the wants of man. But we in general invert the order of nature, placing the greatest value on those things that are difficult to obtain. We burrow in the earth to obtain gold from its bosom and consider it our all in all, whereas we can neither eat nor drink it. When sickness lays its clammy hand on man, he is not apt to look to simple water as a remedy for his disease, but like the Assyrian general when told by the prophet to bathe in Jordan, and be cured of his leprosy, he scouts the simplicity of the act and the medicine, and turns away. As it was with the Philistine warrior, so it is with men at the present day, with but few to retract wisely like him, their first doubtings. Simple salt, is almost a cure for every thing with sailors,—our landsmen would rather seek medicines that come from the Persian Gulf or the wilds of Hindostan.
