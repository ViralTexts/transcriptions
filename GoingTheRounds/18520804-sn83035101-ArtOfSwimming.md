ART OF SWIMMING.â€”Men are drowned by raising their arms above water, the unbuoyed weight of which depresses the head. Other animals have neither motion or ability to act in a similar manner, therefore swim naturally. When a man falls into deep water, he will rise to the surface, and will continue there if he does not elevate his hands. If he moves his hands under water in any way he pleases, his head will rise so high as to allow him free liberty to breathe, and if he will use his legs as in the act of walking (or rather walking upstairs,) his shoulders will rise above the water, so that he may use less exertions with his hands, or apply them to some other purpose. These plain directions are recommended to the recollection of those who have not learned to swim in their youth, as they may be found highly advantageous in preserving life.
