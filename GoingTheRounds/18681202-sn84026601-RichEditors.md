RICH EDITOR,â€”Somebody says editors are poor, whereupon an exchange remarks:

"Humbug!" Here we are, editor of a country newspaper, fairly rolling in wealth. We have a good office, a paste pot, a double-barrelled gun, two suits of clothes, three kittens, a Newfoundland pup, two gold watches, thirteen day and two night shirts, carpet on our floors, a pretty wife, one corner lot, have ninety cents in cash, out of debt, and have no rich relatives. If we are not wealthy it is a pity."
