**Take the Paper**

We find the following going the rounds of the press. Read, ponder, and—PAY UP! Why don't you take the papers? they're the life of my delight, except about election time, and then I read for spite. Subscribe, you cannot loose a cent, why should you be afraid? for cash thus spent is money lent at interest, four-fold paid. Go, then, and take the papers, and pay to-day, nor pay delay, and my word it is inferred, you'll live until you're gray. An old neighbor of mine, while dying of a cough, desired to hear the latest news while he was going off. I took the paper and I read of some new pills in force; he bought a box—and is he dead? no—hearty as a horse. I knew two men as much alike as e'er you saw two stumps; and no phrenologist could find a difference in their bumps. One takes the paper and his life is happier than a king's, his children can all read and write, and talk of men and things. The other took no paper, and, while strolling through the wood, a tree fell down and broke his crown, and killed him—"very good." Had he been reading all the news, at home like his neighbor Jim, I'll be a cent that accident would not have happened him, for he who takes the paper, and pays his bill when due, can live in peace with every man, and with the printer too.
