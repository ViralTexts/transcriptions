EDUCATE YOUR DAUGHTERS.—When I lived among the Choctaw Indians, I held a consultation with one of their principal chiefs, respecting the successive stage of their progress in the arts and virtues of civilized life; and among other things, he informed me at their first start they fell into a great mistake—they only sent their boys to school. They became intelligent men, but they married uneducated and uncivilized wives; and the uniform result was, that the children were all like the mother; and soon the father lost his interest in both wife and children. 'And now,' said he, 'if we could educate only one class of our children, we would choose the girls; for when they become mothers, they would educate their sons.' This is to the point, and it is true. No nation can become fully and permanently civilized and enlightened, when the mothers are not, to a good degree, qualified to discharge the duties of their home work of education.—*Rev. S. Dyer*.
