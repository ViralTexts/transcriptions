Hawthorne Truly Says:
These railroads are positively the greatest blessings that the ages have wrought out for us. They give us wings; they annihilate the toil and dust of pil­grimage; -they spiritualize travel! Tran­sition being so facile, what can be any man's inducement to tarry in one spot? Why should he make himself a prisoner for life in brick, and stone, and old, worm-eaten timber, when he may just as easily dwell wherever the beautiful shall offer him a home?" The magnificent trains of the Santa Fe Route offer a facile transition to many beautiful spots in Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. Free descriptive literature. W. J. Black, G. P. A., A. T. & S. F. Ry., Topeka, Kan.
