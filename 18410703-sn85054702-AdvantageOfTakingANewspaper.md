The following exhibits the genius and talent of a true poet, of one who is destined to render himself immortal by his inspirations. There is a moral to it, an inspiration, which should stir up the soul of very liberal minded and intelligent beings:â€”*Boston Transcript*.

I knew two friends, as much alike  
{:.indent-1}As e'er you saw two stumps;
And no phrenologist could find
{:.indent-1}A difference in their bumps.

One took the papers, and his life
{:.indent-1}Was happier than a king's;
His children all can read and write,
{:.indent-1}And talk of men and things.

The other took no papers, and
{:.indent-1}While strolling through the wood,
A tree fell down upon his crown,
{:.indent-1}And hurt him, as it should!

Had he been reading of the news
{:.indent-1}At home, like neighbor Jim,
I'll bet a cent this accident
{:.indent-1}Would not befallen him!
