RELIGIOUS COURTSHIP.

A young gentleman happening to sit at church in a pew adjoining one in which sat a young lady for whom he conceived a most sudden and violent passion, was desirous of entering into a courtship on the spot; but the place not suiting a formal declaration, the exigency of the case suggested the following plan—

He politely handed his fair neighbor a Bible open, with a pin stuck in the following text,—second epistle of John, verse fifth—"And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which I had from the beginning, that we love one another." 

She returned it, pointing to the following,—second chapter of Ruth, tenth verse:—"Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, why have i found favor in thine eyes, that thou shouldst take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?"

He returned the book, pointing to the 12 verse of the second epistle of John. "Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink; but I trust to come unto you and speak face to face."

From the above interview the marriage took place the ensuing week.
