A plea for humanity.

A Letter, from the Society of Friends in England, to their fellow Christians of all denominations in the United States of America.

Dear friends,
	We venture to address you in the name and on behalf of the religious Society of Friends in Great Britain, a body of men and women who are earnestly desirous that the practice of Christian living, among themselves and others. should be brought into harmony with the teaching and example of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Our hearts have been deeply pained as we have had our attention drawn to the Lynching of persons, both white and coloured, with the terrible scenes of lawlessness and cruelty that frequently accompany them, in some of the States of your Union.
From trustworthy records it appears that in the past ten years many hundreds of persons in the United States of America have been thus, without legal trial, put to death. Many of these have been burnt alive, or otherwise tortured ; and we have sorrowful evidence that in some districts such doings have been condoned, and even actively applauded, by those who in other respects are right-thinking citizens. In addition to this, there is the demoralizing effect of such spectacles on the men, women, and children, large numbers of whom sometimes witness them.
We earnestly desire to avoid falling into a spirit of hasty or harsh judgment on these matters. We recognize with humiliation that there are grave faults in the conduct of our own people that need correcting, and we welcome with the utmost thankfulness the evidence that many among you are fully alive to the claims of humanity, and are doing all they can to remedy the evils alluded to. We leave out of consideration altogether political and racial problems, and difficulties which, at this instance, we can very imperfectly understand, and appeal to you on the broad and simple grounds of Christian principle and human justice.
Our Lord Jesus Christ, in the days of His earthly ministry, when the zealous performance of outward forms of religion was receiving more attention than the practice of love to men, quoted with approval the words of an ancient prophet, “I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.” In direct anticipation of His teaching was the saying of another prophet, that what the Lord requires of us is “to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with our God.” He taught that the sons of God must be “merciful, even as the Father who is in heaven is merciful;” and declared that those who refused to act kindly to one of the least of his brethren were refusing kindness to Himself. In full accord with this spirit, His great Apostle urged that “Love is the fulfilling of the law.” 
As Christians, we believe that it is the spirit of love and tenderness which has so largely removed the barbarous cruelties and the lawless injustice of the dark ages, and, in proportion as it has had free play in any country, we trace to its influence the development of an ordered Commonwealth, in which to the weakest members are granted the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and justice.
In the name of Christ, who died for all men, regardless of name or wealth, race or colour, let us, both in England and America, do what we can to form a public opinion based on the principles of His life and teaching.

We are, in Christian love,
Your Friends.

Signed, on behalf of the “Meeting for Sufferings,”representing the Society of Friends in Great Britain,
Henry Lloyd Wilson.
(Clerk).
