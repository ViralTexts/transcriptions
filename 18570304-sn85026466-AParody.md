{:.indent-3}Tell me, ye winged winds,
{:.indent-3}That rounds my pathway roar,
{:.indent-3}Do ye not know some spot
{:.indent-3}Where women fret no more?
{:.indent-3}Some lone and pleasant dell,
{:.indent-3}Some "holler in the ground,"
{:.indent-3}Where babies never yell,
{:.indent-3}And cradles are not found?
The loud wind blew the snow into my face,
And snickered as it answered—"Nary place."

{:.indent-3}Tell me, thou misty deep,
{:.indent-3}Whose billows round me play,
{:.indent-3}Know'st thou some favored spot,
{:.indent-3}Some Island far away,
{:.indent-3}Where weary men may find
{:.indent-3}A place to smoke in peace,
{:.indent-3}Were crinoline is not,
{:.indent-3}And hoops are out of place!
The loud waves, sounding a perpetual shout,
Stopt for a while, and spluttered, "Yeou git eout."

{:.indent-3}And thou serenest moon,
{:.indent-3}That, with such holy face,
{:.indent-3}Dost look upon the girls
{:.indent-3}With their beaux embrace,
{:.indent-3}Tell me, in all thy round,
{:.indent-3}Hast thou not seen some spot
{:.indent-3}Where muslin is not known,
{:.indent-3}And calico is not?
Behind a cloud the moon withdrew in woe,
And a voice sweet but sad responded, "Pooh!"

{:.indent-3}Tell me, my secret soul—
{:.indent-3}Oh! tell me, Hope and Faith,
{:.indent-3}Is there no resting place
{:.indent-3}From women, girls and death?
{:.indent-3}Is there no happy spot
{:.indent-3}Where bachelors are blessed,
{:.indent-3}Where females never go,
{:.indent-3}And may dwell in peace?
Faith, Hope and Truth—best boons to mortals given—
Waved their bright wings, and answered, "Yes, <em>in Heaven!</em>"
